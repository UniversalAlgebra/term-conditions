# On the Complexity of Computing Difference Terms and Operations

**Abstract.**   
At BLAST 2017 we presented a positive answer to the following practical question:  

    Given a finite idempotent algebra, can we efficiently decide whether 
	the variety generated by that algebra has a difference term? 

We present a new practical result related to this problem. Specifically, we 
discuss the complexity of constructing a difference term *d* for V(__A__) and show that, 
although *d*  may have exponential length, nonetheless there is a polynomial-time 
algorithm that takes as input any algebra **B** in V(__A__) and produces the operation 
table for *d* interpreted in **B**.
