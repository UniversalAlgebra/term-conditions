\section{Introduction}

This is just a small sample file in which are given few rules and examples for preparing file for publishing in NSJOM.  The idea is to have fully functional PDF file with active hyperlinks, quotations and citations in a document. Therefore, using theorem environments is important. Of course, you may use your own definitions.

We intend in future to put more examples which can make preparation of LaTeX file for NSJOM more easier.


If you have any question or doubts, please do not hesitate to ask:

   \href{mailto:nsjom@dmi.uns.ac.rs}{nsjom@dmi.uns.ac.rs}.


\section{Definitions}

If you are putting references, please do in the following way: \cite{dm2}, or \cite{1,2,3}. Also you may use something like \cite[ch. 3]{3}.

Definitions, theorems, lemmas have to be in the appropriate environments.
\begin{defn}
This is just a sample of a definition.
\end{defn}

You may do something like:
\begin{defn}[\cite{dm2}]
This is just a sample of a definition with citation.
\end{defn}
or
\begin{rem}[Gauss]
Here goes a remark.
\end{rem}


\section{Main results}

\begin{thm}\label{TH001}
After theorem usually goes its proof.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Proof  has its own environment which ends with QED symbol.
\end{proof}


\begin{lem}
There holds
\begin{equation}\label{EQ001}
1+1=2.
\end{equation}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
The proof of Equation \eqref{EQ001} is easy.
\end{proof}

Please use labels for easier referring of previous theorems, lemmas and similar. Like

Theorem \ref{TH001} is just an example of \emph{proof} environment.

If you want to use pictures, use it in greyscale:
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[bb=0 0 645 642, width=5truecm,height=5truecm]{PMF.JPG}
\end{center}
\caption{\small Faculty of Sciences, Novi Sad} \label{PIC01}
\end{figure}


For a JPG file you have to define Bounding Box. For EPS it is within a file.

\section*{Acknowledgement}
This is also a place where you can put acknowledgement.


% References must be ordered alphabetically and all have to be cited in the text. Citation should be done using, for instance,  \cite{1}
% Please use the following model. If your references are not in such model, we have to change it, which rises a possibility for a mistake.
