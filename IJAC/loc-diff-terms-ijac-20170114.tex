\begin{abstract}
We consider the following practical question: given a finite algebra $\bA$ in a
finite language, can we efficiently decide whether the variety generated by
$\bA$ has a difference term?  In~\cite{DeMeo:2017}
``local difference terms'' were defined and used to solve 
a related but easier problem---namely, it was shown that
there is a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether any finite idempotent
algebra has a difference term operation. 
In the present paper, we continue to build on the ideas in~\cite{MR3239624}
and complete the project started~\cite{DeMeo:2017}. More specifically,
we define ``global-local difference terms'' which we use to 
devise an efficient algorithm for deciding whether the
variety generated by a finite idempotent algebra has a difference term.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Let $\sV$ be a variety (equational class) of algebras.
A ternary term $d$ in the language of $\sV$ is called 
a \defn{difference term for $\sV$} if it satisfies the following:
for all $\bA = \<A, \dots \> \in \sV$ and $a, b \in A$ we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}  
d^{\bA}(a,a,b) = b \quad \text{ and } \quad
d^{\bA}(a,b,b) \comm \theta \theta a,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is any congruence %% of $\bA$
containing $(a,b)$
and $[\cdot, \cdot]$ denotes the (term condition) commutator.
(See~\cite{HM:1988} or~\cite{MR3076179} for definitions.)
When the relations in (\ref{eq:3}) hold we will call $d^{\bA}$
a \defn{difference term operation} for $\bA$.

Difference terms are studied extensively in the universal algebra literature.
(See, for example, \cite{HM:1988,KSW,MR3449235,MR1358491,MR3076179,MR1663558}.)
There are many reasons to study difference terms, but
perhaps the most obvious is that knowing a variety 
has a difference term allows us to deduce many useful
properties of the algebras inhabiting that variety.
(Very roughly speaking, having a difference term is slightly stronger than having
a Taylor term and slightly weaker than having a Mal'tsev term.
Note that if
$\bA$ is an \defn{abelian} algebra---that is, $[1_A, 1_A] = 0_A$---then by
the monotonicity of the commutator we have
$[\theta, \theta] = 0_A$ for all $\theta \in \Con \bA$, in which case
(\ref{eq:3}) says that $d^{\bA}$ is a Mal'tsev term operation.)

Digital computers have turned out to be invaluable tools for exploring and
understanding algebras and the varieties they inhabit, and this is largely due
to the fact that researchers have found ingenious ways
to get computers to solve abstract decision problems---such as
whether a variety is 
congruence-modular (\cite{Freese:2009}) or
congruence-$n$-permutable (\cite{MR3239624})---and to do so efficiently.
%% , in a way that scales well with problem size.
The contribution of the present paper is to present a solution to the following:
\begin{prob}
  \label{prob:1}
  Is there a polynomial-time algorithm that takes a finite
  idempotent algebra $\bA$ as input and decides whether the variety generated by
  $\bA$ has a difference term?
\end{prob}
By solving Problem~\ref{prob:1} we complete the project started
in~\cite{DeMeo:2017}; in the latter, we solved the following easier problem:
\begin{prob}
  \label{prob:2}
  Is there a polynomial-time algorithm that takes a finite
  idempotent algebra $\bA$ as input and decides whether 
  $\bA$ has a difference term operation?
\end{prob}

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
Section~\ref{sec:definitions} introduces notation and definitions and some of
the background that we expect the reader to have.
In~\cite{MR1358491} 
it was shown that a locally finite idempotent variety $\sV$ has a difference
term if and only if $\sansH \sansS \sansP(\bF_{\sV}(2))$ 
has a difference term (where $\bF_{\sV}(2)$ denotes the 2-generated free algebra in $\sV$).
In Section~\ref{sec:equiv-cond-exist}
we extend this result by showing that this is also equivalent to
the free algebra $\bF_{\sV}(2)$ itself having a difference term operation.
In~\cite{MR3239624},
Valeriote and Willard define 
a ``local Hagemann-Mitschke sequence'' which they use as the basis of
an efficient algorithm for deciding for a given $n$ whether an idempotent
variety is $n$-permutable. 
In Section~\ref{sec:local-diff-terms}
we devise a similar construct, called
a ``local difference term,'' that we use to develop a polynomial-time
algorithm for deciding the existence of a (``global-local'') difference term
operation for $\bA$.  In Section~\ref{sec:glob-local-diff} we introduce 
``global-local difference terms'' which we use to
devise a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether the variety
generated by a finite idempotent algebra has a difference term.


\section{Background, Notation, Definitions}
\label{sec:definitions}
%% The centralizer, term condition, and abelian congruences}
%% We review some useful properties of centralizers and abelian
Our arguments depend on some basic results of universal algebra that we now review.
For the most part we use standard notation such as those found in~\cite{MR2839398}.
However, we make the following exception for notational simplicity:
if $\bA =\<A, \dots\>$ is an algebra with elements 
$a, b \in A$, then we use $\theta(a,b)$ to denote
the congruence of $\bA$ generated by $a$ and $b$.

\renewcommand{\Cg}{\ensuremath{\theta}}

Let $\bA = \<A, F^{\bA}\>$ be an algebra.
A reflexive, symmetric, compatible binary relation $T\subseteq A^2$ is called a
\defn{tolerance of $\bA$}.  
Given a pair $(\bu, \bv) \in A^m\times A^m$ of $m$-tuples of $A$, we write 
$\bu \mathrel{\bT} \bv$ just in case $\bu(i) \mathrel{T} \bv(i)$ for all $0\leq i<m$. 
We state a number of definitions in this section using tolerance relations, but 
the definitions don't change when the tolerance in question happens to be
a congruence relation (i.e., a transitive tolerance).

Suppose $S$ and $T$ are tolerances on $\bA$.  An \defn{$S,T$-matrix} 
is a $2\times 2$ array of the form
\[
\begin{bmatrix*}[r] t(\ba,\bu) & t(\ba,\bv)\\ t(\bb,\bu)&t(\bb,\bv)\end{bmatrix*},
\]
where $t$, $\ba$, $\bb$, $\bu$, $\bv$ have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)] %[label=(\roman*)]
\item $t\in \sansClo_{\ell + m}(\bA)$,
\item $(\ba, \bb)\in A^\ell\times A^\ell$ and $\ba \mathrel{\bS} \bb$,
\item $(\bu, \bv)\in A^m\times A^m$ and $\bu \mathrel{\bT} \bv$.
\end{enumerate}
Let $\delta$ be a congruence relation of $\bA$.
If the entries of every $S,T$-matrix satisfy
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:22}
t(\ba,\bu) \mathrel{\delta} t(\ba,\bv)\quad \iff \quad t(\bb,\bu) \mathrel{\delta} t(\bb,\bv),
\end{equation}
then we say that $S$ \defn{centralizes $T$ modulo} $\delta$ and we write 
$\CC{S}{T}{\delta}$.
That is, $\CC{S}{T}{\delta}$  means that 
(\ref{eq:22}) holds \emph{for all}
$\ell$, $m$, $t$, $\ba$, $\bb$, $\bu$, $\bv$ satisfying properties (i)--(iii).

The \defn{commutator} of $S$ and $T$, denoted by $[S, T]$,
is the least congruence $\delta$ such that $\CC{S}{T}{\delta}$ 
holds.  
Note that $\CC{S}{T}{0_A}$ is equivalent to $[S,T] = 0_A$, and this
is sometimes called the \defn{$S, T$-term condition};
when it holds we say  that
$S$ \defn{centralizes} $T$. %% , and write $\C{S}{T}$.
A tolerance $T$ is called \defn{abelian} if
%% $\C{T}{T}$ (i.e., $[T, T] = 0_A$).  
$[T, T] = 0_A$.  
An algebra $\bA$ is called \defn{abelian} if $1_A$ is abelian
(i.e., $[1_A,1_A] = 0_A$).

%% \begin{rem}
%%   An algebra $\bA$ is abelian iff %$\C{1_A}{1_A}$ iff
%%   \[
%%   \forall \ell, m \in \N,
%%   \quad \forall t\in \sansClo_{\ell + m}(\bA),
%%   \quad \forall (\ba, \bb)\in A^\ell\times A^\ell,
%%   \]
%%   \[
%%   \ker t(\ba, \cdot)=\ker t(\bb, \cdot).
%%   \]
%% \end{rem}

%% wjd: deleting the iterated commutator stuff (I don't think we need it)
%% It is sometimes useful to iterate the commutator, for example,
%% $[[\alpha, \alpha], [\alpha, \alpha]]$, and for this purpose
%% we define $[\alpha]^n$ recursively as
%% follows:
%% $[\alpha]^0 = \alpha$ and
%% $[\alpha]^{n+1} = [[\alpha]^n, [\alpha]^n]$.  A congruence $\alpha$ of $\bA$
%% is called \defn{solvable} if $[\alpha]^n = 0_A$ for some $n$.


Here are some properties of the centralizer relation
that are well-known and not too hard to prove
(see \cite[Prop~3.4]{HM:1988} or~\cite[Thm~2.19]{MR3076179}).
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:centralizers}
Let $\bA$ be an algebra and suppose
$\bB$ is a subalgebra of $\bA$. 
Let $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, $\alpha_i$
$\beta_j$, $\gamma_k$
be congruences of $\bA$, for all 
$i \in I$, $j\in J$, $k \in K$. Then the following hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{centralizing_over_meet}
  $\CC{\alpha}{\beta}{\alpha \meet \beta}$;
\item \label{centralizing_over_meet2}
  if $\CC{\alpha}{ \beta}{ \gamma_k}$ for all $k \in K$, then
  $\CC{\alpha}{ \beta}{ \Meet_{K}\gamma_k}$;
\item \label{centralizing_over_join1}
  if $\CC{\alpha_i}{ \beta}{ \gamma}$ for all $i\in I$, then
  $\CC{\Join_{I}\alpha_i}{ \beta}{\gamma}$;
\item \label{monotone_centralizers1}
  if $\CC{\alpha}{ \beta}{ \gamma}$ and $\alpha' \leq \alpha$, then 
  $\CC{\alpha'}{ \beta}{ \gamma}$;
\item \label{monotone_centralizers2}
  if $\CC{\alpha}{ \beta}{ \gamma}$ and $\beta' \leq \beta$, then
  $\CC{\alpha}{ \beta'}{ \gamma}$;
\item \label{centralizing_over_subalg}
  if $\CC{\alpha}{ \beta}{ \gamma}$ in $\bA$, 
  then $\CC{\alpha\cap B^2}{ \beta\cap B^2}{\gamma\cap B^2}$ in $\bB$;
\item \label{centralizing_factors}
  if $\gamma \leq \delta$, then $\CC{\alpha}{ \beta}{ \delta}$
  in $\bA$ if and only if $\CC{\alpha/\gamma}{ \beta/\gamma}{ \delta/\gamma}$
  in $\bA/\gamma$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}


\begin{rem}
By (\ref{centralizing_over_meet}), 
if $\alpha \meet \beta = 0_{A}$,  
then %$\C{\beta}{\alpha}$ and $\C{\alpha}{\beta}$.
$[\beta, \alpha] = 0_A = [\alpha, \beta]$.

%% \subsection{The commutator}
%% \label{sec:facts-about-comm}
Before proceeding, we collect some facts about the commutator that are
sometimes useful when reasoning about difference terms.


\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:monotone-comm}
  Let $\bA$ be an algebra
  with congruences
  $\alpha$, $\alpha'$, $\beta$, $\beta'$ satisfying
  $\alpha\leq \alpha'$ and $\beta \leq \beta'$.
  Then $\comm \alpha \beta {\leq} \comm {\alpha'} {\beta'}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  For every $\delta \in \Con\bA$, $\CC{\alpha'}{\beta'}{\delta}$ implies
  $\CC{\alpha}{\beta}{\delta}$, since $\alpha\leq \alpha'$ and $\beta \leq \beta'$.
  In particular, $\CC{\alpha'}{\beta'}{[\alpha', \beta']}$ implies
  $\CC{\alpha}{\beta}{[\alpha', \beta']}$, so
  $\comm \alpha \beta {\leq} \comm {\alpha'} {\beta'}$.
\end{proof}



\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:complete-meet-join-monotone}
Let $\bA$ be an algebra with congruences
$\alpha_i$ and 
$\beta_i$ %% $\gamma_k$
%% are congruences of $\bA$, 
for all $i \in I$.
Then
\[
\comm {\Meet \alpha_i} {\Meet \beta_i} {\leq}
\Meet \comm {\alpha_i} {\beta_i}
\quad \text{ and } \quad
\Join \comm {\alpha_i} {\beta_i} {\leq}
\comm {\Join \alpha_i} {\Join \beta_i}.
\]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:monotone-comm}, $\comm {\Meet \alpha_i} {\Meet \beta_i} {\leq}
  \comm {\alpha_i} {\beta_i} {\leq} \comm {\Join \alpha_i} {\Join \beta_i}$,
  for all $i \in I$.
\end{proof}

%% We will apply the preceding result in a simple special case involving
%% just four congruences; we record this version of the result for convenience.
%% %% (delete the corollary later)
%% \begin{cor}
%%   \label{cor:facts-about-comm-1}
%% Let $\bA$ be an algebra with congruences
%% $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$.  Then,

%% \]
%% \end{cor}



\begin{lem}[\protect{\cite[Theorem 2.10]{MR1358491}}]
  Let $\bA$ and $\bB$ be algebras of the same similarity type and suppose
  $\phi: \bA \to \bB$ is a surjective homomorphism.  If
  $\alpha, \beta \in \Con \bA$, then
  $\phi([\alpha, \beta]) \subseteq [\phi(\alpha), \phi(\beta)]$.
  Moreover, if there exists a homomorphism $\psi: \bB \to \bA$ such that
  $\phi \circ \psi = \id_B$ and if $\rho, \sigma \in \Con \bB$, then
 $\psi^{-1} \{[\psi(\rho), \psi(\sigma)]\} = \phi\bigl( [\psi(\rho), \psi(\sigma)]\bigr)
  = [\rho, \sigma]$.

\section{Equivalent conditions for existence of a difference term}
\label{sec:equiv-cond-exist}
The main result proved in this section is Theorem~\ref{thm:F}, which 
is a slightly improved version of the observation
%% We won't use anything in this subsection
%% when proving the main result of this paper; nonetheless, we include it since
%% this result may be of independent interest.
%% Let $\sV$ be a variety.  
in~\cite{MR1358491}
%% In that paper, Kearnes observed that
%% a locally finite variety has a difference term
%% iff it has a Taylor term and no type-2 tails.
%% Let $\sV$ be a variety and let $\bF = \bF_{\sV}(2)$ denote the 2-generated
%% free algebra in $\sV$.
%% Then the assumption that $\sV$ be locally finite can be weakened
%% to the hypothesis that $\bF$ is finite. This was observed in~\cite{MR1358491} 
%% by showing that 
stating that a variety $\sV$ has a difference term if and only if
$\sansH \sansS \sansP(\bF_{\sV}(2))$ 
has a difference term.
%% (where $\bF_{\sV}(2)$ denotes the 2-generated free algebra in $\sV$).
The forward implication of this claim is trivial;
the argument for the converse goes as follows:
assume that $d(x, y, z)$ is a difference term for $\sansH \sansS \sansP(\bF)$.
Choose $\bA \in \sV$ and $a, b \in A$. Let $\bB = \Sg^{\bA} (\{a, b\})$.
Since $\bB$ is 2-generated, $B \in \sansH \sansS \sansP (\bF)$.
Hence $d(x, y, z)$ interprets as a difference term in $\bB$. This means that
$d^{\bA} (a, a, b) = d^{\bB} (a, a, b) = b$.
Furthermore,
\[
d^{\bA} (a, b, b) = d^{\bB} (a, b, b) \mathrel{[\Cg^{\bB} (a, b), \Cg^{\bB} (a, b)]} a.
\]
But $[\Cg^{\bB} (a, b), \Cg^{\bB} (a,b)]\subseteq [\theta, \theta]$ for any congruence
$\theta \in \Con \bA$ for which $(a, b) \in \theta$. Consequently
$d^{\bA} (a, b, b) \mathrel{[\theta, \theta]} a$ as desired.

Considering the goal of the present project, it seems natural
to begin by trying to prove that the existence of a difference term for
 $\sV$ is equivalent to the  existence  of a difference term
\emph{operation} for a specific algebra in $\sV$.  This is achieved in
Theorem~\ref{thm:F}, which will play a key role
in our main complexity argument in Section~\ref{sec:glob-local-diff}.
%{sec:algor-2:-exist}.
%% by establishing the equivalence of item (iii) in the following theorem.

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:F}
Let $\sV$ be a variety and $\bF = \bF_{\sV}(2)$, the 2-generated
free algebra in $\sV$. The following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item \label{item:1}
  $\sV$ has a difference term;
\item \label{item:2}
  $\sansH \sansS \sansP (\bF)$ has a difference term;
\item \label{item:3}
  $\bF$ has a difference term operation.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
  The implications
  (\ref{item:1}) $\Rightarrow$  (\ref{item:2}) $\Rightarrow$  (\ref{item:3}) are
  obvious. We prove
  (\ref{item:3}) $\Rightarrow$  (\ref{item:1}) by contraposition.
  Suppose $\sV$ has no difference term. (We show $\bF$ has no difference term
  operation.)
  Let $d(x,y,z)$ be a ternary term of $\sV$.  Let $\bA\in \sV$ be such that
  $d^{\bA}(x,y,z)$ is not a difference term operation in $\bA$.
  Choose $a, b \in A$ witnessing this fact.  Then either
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item\label{item:4} $d^{\bA}(a,a,b) \neq b$, or
  \item\label{item:5} $(d^{\bA}(a,b,b), a) \notin [\Cg^{\bA} (a, b), \Cg^{\bA} (a,b)]$.
  \end{enumerate}
  Let $\bB = \Sg^{\bA} (\{a, b\})$.  In case
  (\ref{item:4}), 
  $d^{\bB}(a,a,b) = d^{\bA}(a,a,b) \neq b$, so $d^{\bB}(x,y,z)$ is not a difference
  term operation for $\bB$.
  In case (\ref{item:5}), observe that
  the pair $(d^{\bB}(a,b,b), a)$ is equal to the pair $(d^{\bA}(a,b,b), a)$ which
  does not belong to $[\Cg^{\bA} (a, b), \Cg^{\bA} (a,b)]$.
  But 
  $[\Cg^{\bB} (a, b), \Cg^{\bB} (a,b)] \subseteq[\Cg^{\bA} (a, b), \Cg^{\bA} (a,b)]$, so
  \[(d^{\bB}(a,b,b), a) \notin [\Cg^{\bB} (a, b), \Cg^{\bB} (a,b)],\]
  and again we conclude that $d^{\bB}(x,y,z)$ is not a difference term operation for $\bB$.
  Now, since there is a surjective homomorphism from $\bF$ to $\bB$,
  it follows that $d^{\bF}(x,y,z)$ cannot be a difference term operation for $\bF$.
  Finally, recall that $d(x,y,z)$ was an arbitrary ternary term of $\sV$, so
  $\bF$ has no difference term operation whatsoever.
  %% , as we set out to prove.
\end{proof}



\section{Local difference terms}
\label{sec:local-diff-terms}
In~\cite{MR3239624},
Valeriote and Willard define %% an \defn{$\bA$-triple for $\bp$}
%% to be a triple $(a,b,i)$ such that $a, b \in A$ and
%% $p_i(a,b,b) = p_{i+1}(a,a,b)$. They use this to define 
a ``local Hagemann-Mitschke sequence'' which they use as the basis of
an efficient algorithm for deciding for a given $n$ whether an idempotent
variety is $n$-permutable. 
Inspired by that work, we devise a similar construct, called
a ``local difference term,'' that we use to develop a polynomial-time
algorithm for deciding the existence of a (global) difference term operation.
%% , given a finite idempotent algebra $\bA$, whether the variety
%% generated by $\bA$ has a difference term.



Let $\bA=\< A, \dots\>$ be an algebra, fix $a, b \in A$ and
$i \in \{0,1\}$.
%% An \defn{$\bA$-local difference term for
A \defn{local difference term for
  $(a,b,i)$} is a ternary term $p$ satisfying the following:
\begin{align}
%% \text{ if $i=0$, then } & a \comm{\Cg^{\bA}(a,b)}{\Cg^{\bA}(a,b)} p(a,b,b); \label{eq:diff-triple}\\
\text{ if $i=0$, then } & a \comm{\Cg(a,b)}{\Cg(a,b)} p(a,b,b); \label{eq:diff-triple}\\
\text{ if $i=1$, then } &p(a,a,b) = b. \nonumber
\end{align}
%% We often drop the
%% $\bA$ when the algebra is clear from context.
%% For example, we write $\Cg$ in place of $\Cg^{\bA}$, and 
%% call the term $p$ above a local difference term for 
%% $(a,b,i)$.
If $p$ satisfies~(\ref{eq:diff-triple}) for all triples
in some subset $S\subseteq A \times A \times \{0,1\}$, then we call $p$
a \defn{local difference term for $S$}.

Let 
$\sS = A \times A \times \{0,1\}$ and
suppose that every pair
$((a_0, b_0, \chi_0), (a_1, b_1, \chi_1))$
in $\sS^2$ has a local difference term.
That is, for each pair $((a_0, b_0, \chi_0), (a_1, b_1, \chi_1))$, there exists
$p$ such that for each $i \in \{0,1\}$ we have
\begin{align}
  a_i \comm{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}{\Cg(a_i,b_i)} p(a_i,b_i,b_i), & \;
  \text{ if $\chi_i=0$, and }  \label{eq:d-trip-i1}\\
  p(a_i,a_i,b_i) =b_i, & \;
  \text{ if $\chi_i=1$.}\label{eq:d-trip-i2} %\\\nonumber
\end{align}
Under these hypothesis we will prove that every subset $S\subseteq \sS$
has a local difference term.
That is, there is a single term $p$ that works (i.e., satisfies
(\ref{eq:d-trip-i1}) and (\ref{eq:d-trip-i2})) for all $(a_i, b_i, \chi_i) \in S$.
The statement and proof of this new result follows.

\begin{thm} %[\protect{cf.~\cite[Theorem 2.2]{MR3239624}}]
  \label{thm:local-diff-terms}
  Let $\sV$ be an idempotent variety and
  $\bA \in \sV$. Define
  $\sS= A \times A \times \{0,1\}$
  and suppose that every pair
  $((a_0, b_0, \chi_0), (a_1, b_1, \chi_1)) \in \sS^2$
  has a local difference term.
  Then every subset $S \subseteq \sS$,
  has a local difference term.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on the size of $S$.  In the base case, $|S| = 2$,
the claim holds by assumption.
Fix $n\geq 2$ and assume that every subset of $\sS$ of size $2\leq k \leq n$ has a local
difference term. Let
\[
S = \{(a_0, b_0, \chi_0), (a_1, b_1, \chi_1), \dots, (a_{n}, b_{n},\chi_{n})\} \subseteq \sS,\]
so that $|S| = n+1$.  We prove $S$ has a local difference term.

Since $|S| \geq 3$ and $\chi_i \in \{0,1\}$ for all $i$, there must exist
indices $i\neq j$ such that $\chi_i = \chi_j$. Assume without loss of generality
that one of these indices is $j=0$.  Define
the set
$S' = S \setminus \{(a_0, b_0, \chi_0)\}$.
Since $|S'| < |S|$, the set $S'$ has a local difference term $p$.
We split the remainder of the proof into two cases.
%% In the first case $\chi_0 = 0$ and in the second $\chi_0 = 1$.

\vskip3mm

%--------------------------------------
\noindent \underline{Case $\chi_0 = 0$}:
Without loss of generality, suppose that $\chi_1 = %% \chi_2 =
\cdots =\chi_k = 1$,
and $\chi_{k+1} %% = \chi_{k+2} 
= \cdots = \chi_{n} = 0$. Define %% $T$ to be the set
\[T = \{(a_0, p(a_0, b_0, b_0), 0),
(a_1, b_1, 1), (a_2, b_2, 1), 
\dots, (a_k, b_k, 1)\},\] and 
note that $|T| < |S|$.
Let $t$ be a local difference term for $T$.
Define
\[
d(x,y,z) = t(x, p(x,y,y), p(x,y,z)).
\]
Since $\chi_0 =0$, we need to show
$(a_0, d(a_0,b_0,b_0))$ belongs to $\comm{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}$.
We have
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:100000}
  d(a_0,b_0,b_0) =
  t(a_0, p(a_0,b_0,b_0), p(a_0,b_0,b_0))\comm{\tau}{\tau} a_0,
\end{equation}
where we have used $\tau$ to denote $\Cg(a_0, p(a_0,b_0,b_0))$.
Note that
\[(a_0, p(a_0,b_0,b_0)) = (p(a_0,a_0,a_0), p(a_0,b_0,b_0)) \in \Cg(a_0, b_0),\]
%% $(a_0, p(a_0,b_0,b_0))$ is equal to $(p(a_0,a_0,a_0), p(a_0,b_0,b_0))$ which 
%% belongs to $\Cg(a_0, b_0)$,
so $\tau\leq \Cg(a_0,b_0)$. Therefore,
by monotonicity of the commutator we have
$\comm{\tau}{\tau} {\leq} \comm{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}$.
It follows from this and (\ref{eq:100000}) that
%% $d(a_0,b_0,b_0)\comm{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}{\Cg(a_0,b_0)} a_0$,
\[d(a_0,b_0,b_0)\comm{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}{\Cg(a_0,b_0)} a_0,\]
as desired.

For the indices $1\leq i \leq k$ we have $\chi_i =1$, so we prove
$d(a_i,a_i,b_i) = b_i$ for such $i$. Observe,
\begin{align}
  d(a_i,a_i,b_i) &=
  t(a_i, p(a_i,a_i,a_i), p(a_i,a_i,b_i)) \label{eq:200000}\\
  &=t(a_i, a_i, b_i) \label{eq:200001}\\
  &=b_i. \label{eq:200002}
\end{align}
Equation~(\ref{eq:200000}) holds by definition of $d$,~(\ref{eq:200001})
because $p$ is an idempotent local difference term for
$S'$, and~(\ref{eq:200002}) because $t$ is a local difference term for $T$.

The remaining triples in our original set $S$
have indices satisfying $k<j\leq n$ and $\chi_j = 0$.
Thus, for these triples we want
$d(a_j,b_j,b_j)\comm{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}{\Cg(a_j,b_j)} a_j$.
By definition,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:450000}
d(a_j,b_j,b_j) =t(a_j, p(a_j,b_j,b_j), p(a_j,b_j,b_j)).  
\end{equation}
Since $p$ is a local difference term for $S'$, %we have
the pair $(p(a_j,b_j,b_j), a_j)$ belongs to $[\Cg(a_j,b_j), \Cg(a_j,b_j)]$.
%% $(p(a_j,b_j,b_j), a_j)\in [\Cg(a_j,b_j), \Cg(a_j,b_j)]$.
This and 
(\ref{eq:450000}) imply
that 
$(d(a_j, b_j,b_j), t(a_j,a_j,a_j))$
belongs to
$\comm{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}$.
Finally, by idempotence of $t$ we have
\[
d(a_j,b_j,b_j)\comm{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}{\Cg(a_j,b_j)} a_j,\]
as desired.
\\[6pt]
%--------------------------------------
\underline{Case $\chi_0 = 1$}:
%% \\[4pt]
%% Assume $\chi_0 = 1$ and, 
Without loss of generality, suppose $\chi_1 = \chi_2 =\cdots =\chi_k = 0$,
and $\chi_{k+1} = \chi_{k+2} = \cdots = \chi_{n} = 1$. Define 
\[
T = \{(p(a_0, a_0, b_0), b_0, 1),
(a_1, b_1, 0), (a_2, b_2 0), \dots, (a_k, b_k, 0)\},
\]
and note that $|T| < |S|$.
Let $t$ be a local difference term for $T$ and
define
%% \[d(x,y,z) = t(p(x,y,z), p(y,y,z), z).\] 
$d(x,y,z) = t(p(x,y,z), p(y,y,z), z)$. 
Since $\chi_0 =1$, we want $d(a_0,a_0,b_0) = b_0$. By the definition of
$d$,
\begin{equation*}
  d(a_0,a_0,b_0) =
  t(p(a_0,a_0,b_0), p(a_0,a_0,b_0), b_0) =b_0.
\end{equation*}
The last equality holds since $t$ is a local difference term for $T$, thus,
for $(p(a_0, a_0, b_0), b_0, 1)$.

If $1\leq i \leq k$, then $\chi_i =0$, so for these indices we prove
that $(a_i, d(a_i,b_i,b_i))$ belongs to $\comm{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}$.
Again, starting from the definition of $d$ and using idempotence of $p$, we have
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \label{eq:40000}
%%   d(a_i,b_i,b_i) =
%%   t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), p(b_i,b_i,b_i), b_i)=
%%   t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), b_i, b_i).
%% \end{equation}
\begin{align}
  d(a_i,b_i,b_i) &=
  t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), p(b_i,b_i,b_i), b_i)   \label{eq:40000}\\
  &=t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), b_i, b_i). \nonumber
\end{align}
Next, since $p$ is a local difference term for $S'$, we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:50000}
  t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), b_i, b_i)
 \comm{\theta(a_i,b_i)}{\theta(a_i,b_i)}
 t(a_i, b_i, b_i).
\end{equation}
Finally, since $t$ is a local difference term for $T$, hence for
$(a_i, b_i, b_i)$,  %% $(1\leq i \leq k)$,
we have 
$t(a_i, b_i, b_i) \comm{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}{\Cg(a_i,b_i)} a_i$.
Combining this with (\ref{eq:40000}) and (\ref{eq:50000}) yields
$d(a_i,b_i,b_i) \comm{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}{\Cg(a_i,b_i)} a_i$,
as desired.

The remaining elements of our original set $S$
have indices $j$ satisfying $k<j\leq n$ and $\chi_j = 1$.
For these we want $d(a_j,a_j,b_j) = b_j$.
Since $p$ is a local difference term for $S'$, we have
$p(a_j,a_j,b_j) = b_j$, and this along with idempotence of $t$ yields
%%\[ d(a_j,a_j,b_j) =  t(p(a_j,a_j,b_j), p(a_j,a_j,b_j), b_j)=  t(b_j, b_j, b_j) =b_j,\]
\begin{align*}
d(a_j,a_j,b_j) &=
t(p(a_j,a_j,b_j), p(a_j,a_j,b_j), b_j)\\
&=t(b_j, b_j, b_j) =b_j,
\end{align*}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:loc-diff-term}
  A finite idempotent algebra $\bA$ has a difference term operation if and
  only if every pair $((a,b,i), (a',b',i')) \in (A\times A \times \{0,1\})^2$ has a local
  difference term.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  One direction is clear, since a difference term operation for $\bA$ is
  obviously a local difference term for the whole set 
  $A\times A \times \{0,1\}$.
  For the converse, suppose
  each pair in $(A\times A \times \{0,1\})^2$ has a local
  difference term. Then, by Theorem~\ref{thm:local-diff-terms},
  there is a single local difference term for the whole set $A\times A \times \{0,1\}$,
  and this is a difference term operation for $\bA$.  Indeed, if $d$ is a
  local difference term for $A\times A \times \{0,1\}$, then 
  for all $a, b \in A$, we have
  $a \comm{\Cg(a,b)}{\Cg(a,b)} d(a,b,b)$,
  since $d$ is a local difference term for $(a,b,0)$, and we have
  $d(a,a,b) = b$, since $d$ is also a local difference term for
  $(a,b,1)$.
\end{proof}

%% \subsection{Algorithm 1: existence of difference term operations}
%% In this subsection we prove the following:
\subsection*{Algorithm 1: existence of difference term operations}
\begin{cor}
  There is a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input
  any finite idempotent algebra $\bA$ and decides whether
  %% the variety $\bbV(\bA)$ that it generates
  $\bA$ has a difference term operation.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  %% and let  $\sV = \bbV(\bA)$.
  We describe an efficient algorithm for deciding,
  given a finite idempotent algebra $\bA$,
  whether every pair $((a,b,i), (a',b',i')) \in (A\times A \times \{0,1\})^2$ has a local
  difference term.  By Corollary~\ref{cor:loc-diff-term}, this will prove we
  can decide in polynomial-time whether $\bA$ has a difference term operation.
  %% We will then complete the
  %% proof by explaining why $\bA$ has a difference term operation iff the variety
  %% it generates has a difference term. 

  Fix a pair
  $((a,b,i), (a',b',i'))$ in $(A\times A \times \{0,1\})^2$. If $i = i' = 0$,
  then the first projection is a local difference term. If $i = i' = 1$,  
    then the third projection is a local difference term. The two remaining cases to
    consider are (1) $i = 0$ and $i'=1$, and (2)
    $i = 1$ and $i'=0$. Since these are completely symmetric, we only handle the
    first case. Assume  the given pair of triples is
    $((a,b,0), (a',b',1))$.  By definition, a term $t$ is local difference term
    for this pair iff
    \[
    a\comm{\Cg(a,b)}{\Cg(a,b)} t^{\bA}(a,b,b) \; \text{ and } \;
    t^{\bA}(a',a',b') = b'.
    \]
    We can rewrite this condition more compactly by
    considering 
    \[t^{\bA\times \bA}((a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b')) =
    (t^{\bA}(a,b,b),t^{\bA}(a',a',b')).\]
    Clearly $t$ is a local difference term for
    $((a,b,0), (a',b',1))$ iff
    \[
    t^{\bA\times \bA}((a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b'))\in a/\delta \times \{b'\},
    \]
    where $\delta = [\Cg(a,b), \Cg(a,b)]$ and $a/\delta$ denotes the
    $\delta$-class containing $a$.
    (Observe that $a/\delta \times \{b'\}$ is a subalgebra of $\bA \times \bA$
    by idempotence.)
    It follows that the pair
    $((a,b,0), (a',b',1))$ has a local difference term iff
    the subuniverse of $\bA\times \bA$ generated by
    $\{(a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b')\}$ intersects nontrivially with the subuniverse
    $a/\delta \times \{b'\}$.

    Thus, the algorithm takes as input $\bA$ and, for each 
    $((a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b'))$ in $(A\times A)^3$, computes
    $\delta = [\Cg(a,b), \Cg(a,b)]$, computes the subalgebra
    $\bS$ of $\bA\times \bA$ generated by
    %% \Sg^{\bA\times \bA}\{(a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b')\}$, and then
    $\{(a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b')\}$, and then
    tests whether $S \cap (a/\delta \times \{b'\})$ is empty.
    If we find an empty intersection at any point, then
    $\bA$ has a difference term operation.
    Otherwise the algorithm halts without witnessing an empty
    intersection, in which case $\bA$ has a difference term operation.

    Most of the operations carried out by this algorithm are well known to be
    polynomial-time.  For example, that the running time of subalgebra generation is
    polynomial has been known for a long time (see~\cite{MR0455543}).
    The time complexity of congruence generation is also known to be polynomial
    (see~\cite{MR2470585}).  The only operation whose tractability might be 
    questionable is the commutator, but there is a straight-forward algorithm for
    computing it which, after the congruences have been computed, simply
    involves generating more subalgebras.
    %% Finally, we observe that if $\bA$ has a difference term operation, then the
    %% variety it generates has a difference term.
    \\\\
    TODO: insert more details about complexity of commutator.\\
\end{proof}


More details on the complexity of operations carried out by the algorithm, as well as many other algebraic operations, can be found in the references mentioned, as well as~\cite{MR1871085,MR1695293,Freese:2009}. 


\section{Global-local difference terms}
\label{sec:glob-local-diff}
The methods from the previous section can be lifted
up to subuniverses, as we now describe.
Let $\sV$ be a variety, let $\bA = \<A, \dots\>$ and $\bB = \<B, \dots\>$ be algebras in
$\sV$, and let $i\in \{0,1\}$.
We call a term $d$ a \defn{global-local difference term for $(A, B, i)$}
provided for all $a, a'\in A$ and $b, b' \in B$ we have
\begin{align}
\text{ if $i=0$, then } & a \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} d^{\bA}(a,a',a');
\label{eq:global-diff-triple}\\
\text{ if $i=1$, then } &
d^{\bB}(b,b,b') = b'. 
\end{align}
Let $\Sub(\bA)$ denote the set of all
subuniverses of $\bA$. In the next theorem we will use the following notation and terminology:
$\sS(\bA):= \Sub(\bA) \times \Sub(\bA) \times \{0,1\}$, and for any
sequence
\[S = ((A_0, B_0, \chi_0), (A_1, B_1, \chi_1), \dots,
(A_{n-1},B_{n-1},\chi_{n-1})) \in \sS(\bA)^n,
\]
a term $d$ is a \defn{global-local difference term for $S$}
if $d$ is a global-local difference term for every triple in $S$.

Throughout this section $|S|$ denotes the \emph{length of the
sequence $S$}.

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:glob-loc-diff-terms}
  Let $\sV$ be an idempotent variety and
  $\bA \in \sV$. 
  If every pair
  $((A_0, B_0, \chi_0), (A_1, B_1, \chi_1)) \in \sS(\bA) \times \sS(\bA)$
  has a global-local difference term,
  then, for all $n\geq 2$, every sequence $S \in \sS(\bA)^n$
  has a global-local difference term.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on $|S|$, the length of the sequence
$S$.

In the base case, $|S| = 2$, the claim holds by assumption.
Fix $n\geq 2$ and assume that every sequence in $\sS(\bA)^k$ of length $2\leq k \leq n$ has
a global-local difference term. Let
$S = ((A_0, B_0, \chi_0), (A_1, B_1, \chi_1), \dots, (A_{n}, B_{n},\chi_{n})) \in \sS(\bA)^{n+1}$.
%% so that $|S| = n+1$.  
We will prove that $S$ has a global-local difference term.

Since $|S| \geq 3$ and $\chi_i \in \{0,1\}$ for all $i$, there must exist
indices $i\neq j$ such that $\chi_i = \chi_j$. Assume without loss of generality
that one of these indices is $j=0$.  Define the subsequence
$S' = ((A_1, B_1, \chi_1), \dots,(A_{n}, B_{n},\chi_{n}))$ of $S$. %% \in \sS(\bA)^{n}$
Since $|S'| = n$, the sequence $S'$ has a global-local difference term $p$.
Thus, for all $1\leq i \leq n$,
for all $a, a'\in A_i$ and $b, b' \in B_i$ we have
\begin{align*}
  \text{ if $\chi_i=0$, then } &
  a \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} d^{\bA_i}(a,a',a');\\
  \text{ if $\chi_i=1$, then } &
  d^{\bB_i}(b,b,b') = b'.
\end{align*}

We split the remainder of the proof into two cases.%%  In the first case
%% $\chi_0 = 0$ and in the second
%% $\chi_0 = 1$.

\vskip3mm

%--------------------------------------
\noindent \underline{Case $\chi_0 = 0$:}
Without loss of generality, suppose that
$\chi_1 = \chi_2 = \cdots =\chi_k = 1$,
and
$\chi_{k+1} = \chi_{k+2} = \cdots = \chi_{n} = 0$.
Define
%% the set
%% \[P_0 = \{p(b, b', b')  \in B_0 \mid b, b' \in B_0\},\]
%% and let
\[
T = ((A_0, B_0, 0), (A_1, B_1, 1), (A_2, B_2, 1), \dots, (A_k, B_k, 1)).
\]
Note that $|T| < |S|$.
Let $t$ be a global-local difference term for $T$.
We will prove that the term $d(x,y,z) = t(x, p(x,y,y), p(x,y,z))$
is a global-local difference term for the sequence $S$.

The first triple in $S$ is $(A_0, B_0, 0)$, so we need to show for all $a$, $a' \in A_0$
that
\[
d^{\bA_0}(a,a',a') \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} a.
\]
Fix $a, a' \in A_0$.
By definition of $d$, and since
$t$ is a global-local difference term for $(A_0, B_0,0)$, we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:100100}
  d^{\bA_0}(a,a',a') 
  =t^{\bA_0}(a, a'', a'')\comm{\theta(a, a'')}{\theta(a, a'')} a,
\end{equation}
where $a'' = p^{\bA_0}(a,a',a')$.
Now,
$(a, a'') = (p^{\bA_0}(a,a,a), p^{\bA_0}(a,a',a')) \in \theta(a, a')$, therefore,
$\theta(a, a'') \leq \theta(a,a')$.
It follows from this and monotonicity of the commutator that
$\comm{\theta(a, a'')}{\theta(a, a'')} {\leq} \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')}$,
This and~(\ref{eq:100100}) imply
$d^{\bA_0}(a,a',a')\comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} a$,
as desired.

For indices $1\leq i \leq k$ we have $\chi_i =1$, so we wish to prove
that for all $b$, $b' \in B_i$ we have
$d^{\bA_i}(b,b,b') = b'$.
Fix $b, b' \in B_i$ and observe that
\begin{align}
  d^{\bB_i}(b,b,b') &=
  t(b, p^{\bB_i}(b,b,b), p^{\bB_i}(b,b,b')) \label{eq:210200}\\
  &=t^{\bB_i}(b, b, b') \label{eq:220201}\\
  &=b'. \label{eq:230202}
\end{align}
Equation~(\ref{eq:210200}) holds by definition of $d$,~(\ref{eq:220201})
because $p$ is an idempotent global-local difference term for
$S'$, and~(\ref{eq:230202}) because $t$ is a global-local difference term for $T$.

The remaining triples in our original sequence $S$
have indices satisfying $k<j\leq n$ and $\chi_j = 0$.
Thus, for these triples we prove
for all $a, a' \in A_j$ that
$d^{\bA_j}(a,a',a')\comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} a$.
Fix $a, a' \in A_j$.
By definition,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:451}
d^{\bA_j}(a,a',a') =t^{\bA_j}(a, p^{\bA_j}(a,a',a'), p^{\bA_j}(a,a',a')).  
\end{equation}
Also, $p^{\bA_j}(a,a',a') \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} a$,
since $p$ is a global-local difference term for $S'$.
%% $(p^{\bA_j}(a,a',a'), a)\in [\theta(a,a'), \theta(a,a')]$.
This and (\ref{eq:451}) imply
that
%% $(d^{\bA_j}(a, a',a'), t^{\bA_j}(a,a,a))$ belongs to $\comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')}$.
$d^{\bA_j}(a, a',a') \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} t^{\bA_j}(a,a,a))$.
Finally, by idempotence of $t$ we have
$d^{\bA_j}(a,a',a')\comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} a$,
as desired.
\\[6pt]
%--------------------------------------
\underline{Case $\chi_0 = 1$:}
Without loss of generality, suppose $\chi_1 = \chi_2 =\cdots =\chi_k = 0$,
and $\chi_{k+1} = \chi_{k+2} = \cdots = \chi_{n} = 1$.
%% Define the set
%% \[P_1 = \{p(b, b', b')  \in B_0 \mid b, b' \in B_0\},\]
Define
\[T = ((A_0, B_0, 1), (A_0, B_1, 0), (A_2, B_2, 0), \dots, (A_k, B_k, 0)),
\]
and note that $|T| < |S|$, so $T$ has a global-local difference term $t$.
We will prove that the term $d(x,y,z) = t(p(x,y,z), p(y,y,z), z)$
is a global-local difference term for the  sequence $S$.

The first triple in $S$ is $(A_0, B_0, 1)$, so we want to show for all $b$, $b' \in B_0$ that
$d(b,b,b') = b'$.
Fix $b$, $b' \in B_0$. By definition of $d$,
%% \begin{equation*}  d(b,b,b') = t(p(b,b,b'), p(b,b,b'), b') =b'.\end{equation*}
we have $d^{\bB_0}(b,b,b') = t^{\bB_0}(p^{\bB_0}(b,b,b'), p^{\bB_0}(b,b,b'), b') =b'$.
The last equality holds since $t$ is a global-local difference term for $T$, thus,
for $(A_0, B_0, 1)$.

If $1\leq i \leq k$, then $\chi_i =0$, so for these indices we want
for all $a, a' \in A_i$ that
\[
d^{\bA_i}(a,a',a') \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} a.
\]
Fix $a, a'\in A_i$.
By definition of $d$ and idempotence of $p$, we have
\begin{align}
  d^{\bA_i}(a,a',a') &=
  t^{\bA_i}(p^{\bA_i}(a,a',a'), p^{\bA_i}(a',a',a'), a')   \label{eq:444}\\
  &=t^{\bA_i}(p^{\bA_i}(a,a',a'), a', a'). \nonumber
\end{align}
Next, since $p$ is a global-local difference term for $S'$, we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:555}
  t^{\bA_i}(p^{\bA_i}(a,a',a'), a', a')
 \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')}
 t^{\bA_i}(a, a', a').
\end{equation}
Finally, since $t$ is a global-local difference term for $T$, hence for
$(a, a', a')$,  %% $(1\leq i \leq k)$,
we have 
\[
t^{\bA_i}(a, a', a') \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} a.
\]
Combining this with (\ref{eq:444}) and (\ref{eq:555}) yields
$d^{\bA_i}(a,a',a') \comm{\theta(a,a')}{\theta(a,a')} a$,
as desired.

The remaining elements of our original sequence $S$
have indices $j$ satisfying $k<j\leq n$ and $\chi_j = 1$.
For these we want to prove for all $b, b'\in B_j$ that $d^{\bB_j}(b,b,b') = b'$.
Fix $b, b'\in B_j$. Since $p$ is a global-local difference term for $S'$, we have
$p^{\bB_j}(b,b,b') = b'$, and this along with idempotence of $t$ yields
%%\[ d(b,b,b') =  t(p(b,b,b'), p(b,b,b'), b')=  t(b', b', b') =b',\]
%% \begin{align*}
%% d^{\bB_j}(b,b,b') &=
%% t^{\bB_j}(p^{\bB_j}(b,b,b'), p^{\bB_j}(b,b,b'), b')\\
%% &=t^{\bB_j}(b', b', b') =b',
%% \end{align*}
\[
d^{\bB_j}(b,b,b') =
t^{\bB_j}(p^{\bB_j}(b,b,b'), p^{\bB_j}(b,b,b'), b')
=t^{\bB_j}(b', b', b') =b'\]
as desired.
\end{proof}

If $\sA$ be a collection of similar algebras, we will use the notation
$\Sub(\sA)$ to denote the collection of all subuniverses of all algebras in
$\sA$.
That is,
\[
\Sub(\sA) = \bigcup_{\bA \in \sA} \Sub(\bA).
\]
By further abuse of notation, we let
\[
\sS(\sA) = \Sub(\sA) \times \Sub(\sA) \times \{0,1\},
\]
so $(A, B, i)\in \sS(\sA)$ indicates that
$A$ is a subuniverse of some algebra in $\sA$,
and $B$ is a subuniverse of some (possibly different) algebra in $\sA$,
and $i\in \{0,1\}$.
\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:glob-loc-diff-term}
  Let $\sV$ be a variety.  Let $\sA$ be a collection of finite idempotent
  algebras in $\sV$ that is closed under the taking of subalgebras.
  Then there exists a term $d$ that is a difference term operation for every
  algebra in $\sA$ if and only if every
  $((A,B,i), (A',B',i')) \in \sS(\sA)^2$ has a global-local
  difference term.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  One direction is clear, since a difference term for all of $\sA$ is
  obviously a global-local difference term for the whole set $\sS(\sA)$.
  For the converse, suppose
  each pair in $\sS(\sA)^2$ has a global-local
  difference term. Then, by Theorem~\ref{thm:glob-loc-diff-terms},
  there is a single global-local difference term for the whole set
  $\sS(\sA)$
  and this is a difference term for all of $\sA$.  Indeed, suppose $d$ is a
  global-local difference term for $\sS(\sA)$ and fix $\bA \in \sA$. We show
  that $d$ is a difference term operation for $\bA$. Indeed,
  %% $d$ is a global-local difference term for $((A, A, 0), (A,A,1)$,
  so for all  $a, a' \in A$ we have 
  $a \comm{\Cg(a,a')}{\Cg(a,a')} d(a,a',a')$,
  since $d$ is a global-local difference term for $(A,A,0)$, and we have
  $d(a,a,a') = a'$, since $d$ is a global-local difference term for
  $(A,A,1)$.
\end{proof}

%% \label{sec:proofs-elem-facts}

\section{More About Abelian Algebras}
\label{sec:abelian-algebras}
Here are some additional facts about abelian algebras that are sometimes useful.

\begin{lem}
If $\Clo(\bA)$ is trivial (i.e., generated by the projections),
then $\bA$ is abelian.
\end{lem}
In fact, it can be shown that $\bA$ is \emph{strongly abelian} in this case, but
we won't prove this stronger result. The proof that $\bA$ is abelian is
elementary is a nice and easy example of a standard proof technique---induction on
term height.\footnote{This proof would be a good one to try in a proof assistant
  like Coq, since such tools excel at inductive arguments like this one.}
\begin{proof}
We want to show $\sansC(1_A, 1_A)$.  Equivalently, we must show
that for all $t\in \Clo(\bA)$ (say, $(\ell+m)$-ary) 
and all $a, b \in A^\ell$, we have $\ker t(a,\cdot)=\ker t(b,\cdot)$.
We prove this by induction on the height of the term $t$.  Height-one terms are
projections and the result is obvious for these.  Let $n>1$ and assume the result
holds for all terms  of height less than
$n$.  Let $t$ be a term of height $n$, say, $k$-ary.  Then for some terms 
$g_1, \dots, g_k$ of height less than $n$ and for some $j\leq k$, we have
$t = p^k_j [g_1, g_2, \dots, g_k] = g_j$ and since $g_j$ has height less than
$n$, we have
\[
\ker t(a,\cdot)=\ker g_j(a,\cdot) = \ker g_j(b,\cdot)=\ker t(b,\cdot).
\]\end{proof}


\begin{lem}
 An algebra $\bA$ is abelian if and only if there is some 
 $\theta \in \Con (\bA^2)$ that has the diagonal $D(A):= \{(a,a): a \in A\}$ 
 as a congruence class.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
($\Leftarrow$) Assume $\Theta$ is such a congruence.  Fix 
  $k<\omega$,
  $t^{\bA}\in \Clo_{k+1}(\bA)$, 
  $u, v \in A$, and
  $\bx, \by \in A^k$.
  We will prove the implication~(\ref{eq:22}), which in the present context is
\begin{equation*}
t^\bA(\bx,u) = t^\bA(\by,u) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad 
t^{\bA}(\bx,v) = t^{\bA}(\by,v).
\end{equation*}
Since $D(A)$ is a class of $\Theta$, we have 
  $(u,u) \mathrel{\Theta} (v,v)$, and since $\Theta$ is a reflexive relation, we have
  $(x_i,y_i)  \mathrel{\Theta} (x_i,y_i)$ for all $i$.  Therefore,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:9}  
  t^{\bA\times \bA}((x_1,y_1), \dots, (x_k,y_k), (u,u))
  \mathrel{\Theta}
  t^{\bA\times \bA}((x_1,y_1), \dots, (x_k,y_k), (v,v)).
\end{equation}
  since $t^{\bA \times \bA}$ is a term operation of $\bA\times \bA$.
  Note that~(\ref{eq:9}) is equivalent to
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:13}
    (t^{\bA}(\bx, u), t^{\bA}(\by,u))
    \mathrel{\Theta}
    (t^{\bA}(\bx, v), t^{\bA}(\by, v)).
  \end{equation}
  If $t^{\bA}(\bx, u)= t^{\bA}(\by, u)$ then 
  the first pair in~(\ref{eq:13}) belongs to the $\Theta$-class
  $D(A)$, so the second pair must also belong this $\Theta$-class.
  That is, $t^{\bA}(\bx, v)= t^{\bA}(\by, v)$, as desired.

  \noindent ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $\bA$ is abelian. We show
  $\Cg^{\bA^2}(D(A)^2)$ has $D(A)$ as a block.  Assume
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:16}
  ((x,x), (c,c')) \in \Cg^{\bA^2}(D(A)^2).
  \end{equation}
  It suffices to prove that $c=c'$.  Recall, \malcev's congruence generation
  theorem states that (\ref{eq:16}) holds iff
  %$(x,x) \theta (c,c') \in \Cg^{\bA^2}(D(A)^2)$ iff %% for $0\leq i \leq n$ and 
  %% $0\leq j \leq n-1$, there exist
  \begin{align*}
  \exists \,& (z_0,z_0'), (z_1,z_1'), \dots, (z_n,z_n') \in A^2\\
    \exists \,& ((x_0,x_0'), (y_0,y_0')), ((x_1,x_1'), (y_1,y_1')), \dots, 
    ((x_{n-1},x_{n-1}'), (y_{n-1},y_{n-1}')) \in D(A)^2\\
    \exists \, & f_0, f_1, \dots, f_{n-1}\in F^*_{\bA^2}
  \end{align*}
  %% \begin{align*}
  %% (z_i,z_i') &\in A^2\\
  %% ((x_j,x_j'), (y_j,y_j')) &\in D(A)^2\\
  %% f_j &\in F^*_{\bA^2}
  %% \end{align*}
  such that 
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:7}
    \{(x, x),(z_1,z_1')\} &= \{f_0(x_0,x_0'), f_0(y_0,y_0')\}\\
\nonumber
     \{(z_1,z_1'),(z_2,z_2')\} &= \{f_1(x_1,x_1'), f_1(y_1,y_1')\}\\
\nonumber
     & \vdots\\
    \label{eq:8}
     \{(z_{n-1},z_{n-1}'),(c, c')\} &= \{f_{n-1}(x_{n-1},x_{n-1}'), f_{n-1}(y_{n-1},y_{n-1}')\}
 \end{align}
The notation $f_i\in F^*_{\bA^2}$ means 
\begin{align*}
f_i(x, x') &= g_i^{\bA^2}((a_1, a_1'), (a_2, a_2'), \dots, (a_k, a_k'), (x, x'))\\
&= (g_i^{\bA}(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k, x), g_i^{\bA}(a_1', a_2', \dots, a_k', x')),
\end{align*}
for some $g_i^{\bA} \in \Clo_{k+1}(\bA)$ and some constants 
$\ba = (a_1, \dots, a_k)$ and $\ba' = (a_1', \dots, a_k')$ in $A^k$. 
Now, $((x_i,x_i'), (y_i,y_i'))\in D(A)^2$ implies 
$x_i=x_i'$, and $y_i=y_i'$, so in fact we have 
\[
     \{(z_i,z_i'),(z_{i+1},z_{i+1}')\} = \{f_i(x_i,x_i), f_i(y_i,y_i)\} \quad (0\leq i < n).
\]
Therefore, by Equation~(\ref{eq:7}) we have either 
\[
     (x,x)= (g_i^{\bA}(\ba, x_0), g_i^{\bA}(\ba', x_0)) \quad \text{ or } \quad 
     (x,x)= (g_i^{\bA}(\ba, y_0), g_i^{\bA}(\ba', y_0)).
\]
Thus, either $g_i^{\bA}(\ba, x_0) =  g_i^{\bA}(\ba', x_0)$ %\quad \text{ or } \quad 
or $g_i^{\bA}(\ba, y_0) =  g_i^{\bA}(\ba', y_0)$.
By the abelian assumption, if one of these equations holds, then so does the
other. This and and Equation (\ref{eq:7}) imply $z_1 = z_1'$.  Applying the same
argument inductively, we find that $z_i = z_i'$ for all $1\leq i < n$ and so, by
(\ref{eq:8}) and the abelian property, we have $c= c'$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}
Suppose $\rho\colon A_1 \to A_2$ is a bijection and suppose the graph
$\{(x, \rho x) \mid x \in A_1\}$ is a block of some congruence
$\beta \in \Con (A_1 \times A_2)$.  Then both $\bA_1$ and $\bA_2$ are abelian.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Define the relation $\alpha\subseteq (A_1\times A_1)^2$ as follows: for
  $((a,a'), (b,b')) \in (A_1\times A_1)^2$,
  \[
  (a,a')\mathrel{\alpha} (b,b')
  \quad \iff \quad
  (a, \rho a') \mathrel{\beta} (b, \rho b')
  \]
  We prove that the diagonal $D(A_1)$ is a block of $\alpha$ by showing that
  $(a, a) \mathrel{\alpha} (b,b')$ implies $b = b'$.
  Indeed, if $(a, a) \mathrel{\alpha} (b,b')$, then
  $(a, \rho a) \mathrel{\beta} (b, \rho b')$, which means that
  $(b, \rho b')$ belongs to the block and
  $(a, \rho a)/\beta = \{(x, \rho x): x\in A_1\}$.  Therefore,
  $\rho b  = \rho b'$, so $b = b'$ since $\rho$ is injective.
  This proves that $\bA_1$ is abelian.

  To prove $\bA_2$ is abelian, we reverse the roles of $A_1$ and $A_2$ in the
  foregoing argument.  
  If $\{(x, \rho x) \mid x \in A_1\}$ is a block of $\beta$,
  then 
  $\{(\rho^{-1}(\rho x), \rho x) \mid \rho x \in A_2\}$ is a block of $\beta$; that
  is, $\{(\rho^{-1} y, y) \mid y \in A_2\}$ is a block of $\beta$.  Define 
  the relation $\alpha\subseteq (A_2\times A_2)^2$ as follows: for
  $((a,a'), (b,b')) \in (A_2\times A_2)^2$,
  \[
  (a,a')\mathrel{\alpha} (b,b')
  \quad \iff \quad
  (\rho^{-1}a, \rho a') \mathrel{\beta} (\rho^{-1}b, \rho b').
  \]
  As above, we can prove that the diagonal $D(A_2)$ is a block of $\alpha$
  by using the injectivity of $\rho^{-1}$ to show that $(a, a) \mathrel{\alpha}
  (b,b')$
  implies $b = b'$.

\subsection{Definitions} %: tolerance, centralizing, abelian}
Let $\bA = \<A, F^{\bA}\>$ be an algebra.
A reflexive, symmetric, compatible binary relation $T\subseteq A^2$ is called a
\defn{tolerance of $\bA$}.  
As a compatible binary relation, a tolerance is a subuniverse of $\bA^2$.
If $T$ is a tolerance of $\bA$, and if $(\bu, \bv) \in A^m\times A^m$
is a pair of $m$-tuples of $A$, then we write 
$\bu \mathrel{\bT} \bv$ just in case $\bu(i) \mathrel{T} \bv(i)$ for all $i\in \mm$. 
(Here we have surreptitiously introduced another very convenient notation, namely,
$\mm := \{0, 1, 2, \dots, m-1\}$.)

Suppose $S$ and $T$ are tolerances on $\bA$.  An \defn{$S,T$-matrix} 
is a $2\times 2$ array of the form
\[
\begin{bmatrix*}[r] t(\ba,\bu) & t(\ba,\bv)\\ t(\bb,\bu)&t(\bb,\bv)\end{bmatrix*},
\]
where $t$, $\ba$, $\bb$, $\bu$, $\bv$ have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $t\in \Clo_{\ell + m}(\bA)$,
\item $(\ba, \bb)\in A^\ell\times A^\ell$ and $\ba \mathrel{\bS} \bb$,
\item $(\bu, \bv)\in A^m\times A^m$ and $\bu \mathrel{\bT} \bv$.
\end{enumerate}
Let $\delta$ be a congruence relation of $\bA$.
If the entries of every $S,T$-matrix satisfy
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:22}
t(\ba,\bu) \mathrel{\delta} t(\ba,\bv)\quad \iff \quad t(\bb,\bu) \mathrel{\delta} t(\bb,\bv),
\end{equation}
then we say that $S$ \defn{centralizes $T$ modulo} $\delta$ and we write 
$\sansC(S, T; \delta)$.
That is, $\sansC(S, T; \delta)$ holds iff 
(\ref{eq:22}) holds \emph{for all}
$\ell$, $m$, $t$, $\ba$, $\bb$, $\bu$, $\bv$ satisfying properties (i)--(iii).
The condition $\sansC(S, T; 0_{A})$ is sometimes called the 
\defn{$S, T$-term condition}, and when it holds we say  that
$S$ \defn{centralizes} $T$, and write
$\sansC(S, T)$.
%% REMOVING THIS since I don't think we ever use the commutator notation again.
%% The \defn{commutator} of $\bS$ and $\bT$, denoted by $[\bS, \bT]$,
%% is the least congruence $\delta$ such that $\sansC(\bS, \bT; \delta)$ 
%% holds.  

A tolerance $T$ is called \defn{abelian} if
$\sansC(T, T)$. %(i.e., $[\bT, \bT] = 0_A$).  
An algebra $\bA$ is called \defn{abelian} if $1_A$ is abelian.
%% (i.e., $[1_A, 1_A] = 0_A$).
%% The \defn{centralizer of $\bT$ modulo $\delta$}, denoted by
%% $(\delta : \bT )$, is the largest congruence $\alpha$ on $\bA$ such that 
%% $\sansC(\alpha, \bT ; \delta)$ holds.

\begin{rem}
An algebra $\bA$ is abelian iff $\sansC(1_A, 1_A)$ iff
\[
\forall \ell \in \{0,1,2,\dots \}, 
\quad \forall m \in  \{1,2,\dots \},
\quad \forall t\in \Clo_{\ell + m}(\bA),
\quad \forall (a, b)\in A^\ell\times A^\ell,
\]
\[
\ker t(a, \cdot)=\ker t(b, \cdot).
\]
\end{rem}










\begin{lem}[Lemma \ref{lem:M3-abelian}]
If $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, $\alpha_3 \in \Con(\bA)$ are pairwise complements,
then $\sansC(1_A, \alpha_i)$ for each $i=1,2,3$.  If, in addition, $\bA$ is
idempotent and has a Taylor term operation, then $\sansC(1_A, 1_A)$; that is, $\bA$ is abelian.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  The goal is to prove $\sansC(1_A, 1_A)$.
  By Lemma~\ref{lem:centralizers}~(\ref{fact:centralizing_over_meet}), we have
  $\sansC(\alpha_1, \alpha_2; \alpha_1 \meet \alpha_2)$.  
  Since $\alpha_1 \meet \alpha_2= 0_A$, this means
  $\sansC(\alpha_1, \alpha_2)$.
  Similarly, $\sansC(\alpha_3, \alpha_2)$.  Therefore, by 
  Lemma~\ref{lem:centralizers}~(\ref{fact:centralizing_over_join1}), we have
  $\sansC(\alpha_1 \join \alpha_3, \alpha_2)$. This is equivalent to 
  $\sansC(1_A, \alpha_2)$, since $\alpha_1 \join \alpha_3 = 1_A$. 
  The same argument \emph{mutatis-mutandis} yields
  $\sansC(1_A,\alpha_1)$ and $\sansC(1_A,\alpha_3)$. 
  Before proceeding, note that $\sansC(\alpha_1, \alpha_1)$, by 
  Lemma~\ref{lem:centralizers}~(\ref{fact:monotone_centralizers1}).
  Now, if $\bA$ is idempotent and has a Taylor term operation, then
  by \ref{thm:kearnes-kiss-3.27} we have 
  $\sansC(\alpha_1 \join \alpha_2,\alpha_1 \join \alpha_2; \alpha_2)$.
  That is, $\sansC(1_A,1_A; \alpha_2)$.
  Similarly, $\sansC(1_A,1_A; \alpha_3)$.
  By~\ref{lem:centralizers}~(\ref{fact:centralizing_over_meet2}) then, 
  $\sansC(1_A,1_A; \alpha_2 \meet\alpha_3)$. 
  That is, $\sansC(1_A,1_A)$.

\begin{rem}
By (\ref{fact:centralizing_over_meet}), 
if $\alpha \meet \beta = 0_{\bA}$,  
then $\sansC(\beta, \alpha)$ and $\sansC(\alpha, \beta)$.
By (\ref{fact:dual_monotone_centralizers}),
if an algebra $\bA$ is abelian, 
then $\sansC(1_A, 1_A; \theta)$ for all $\theta \in \Con(\bA)$, so

$\bA/\theta$ is abelian for every $\theta \in \Con(\bA)$.
\end{rem}

We close this section with a collection of lemmas that can be useful for showing 
that an algebra is abelian.  Proofs of these facts appear in Appendix
Section~\ref{sec:proofs-elem-facts}.

We denote the diagonal of $A$ by $D(A) := \{(a,a): a \in A\}$. 
\begin{lem}
\label{lem:diagonal}
An algebra $\bA$ is abelian if and only if there is some $\theta \in \Con (\bA^2)$ that has
the diagonal set $D(A)$ as a congruence class.
\end{lem}

Lemma~\ref{lem:diagonal} can be used to prove the next result
which states that if there is a congruence of $\bA_1 \times \bA_2$ that has the
graph of a bijection between $A_1$ and $A_2$ as a block, then both $\bA_1$ and
$\bA_2$ are abelian algebras.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:bijection_abelian}
Suppose $\rho \colon A_0 \to A_1$ is a bijection and suppose the graph
$\{(x, \rho x) \mid x \in A_0\}$ is a block of some congruence
$\beta \in \Con (A_0 \times A_1)$.  Then both $\bA_0$ and $\bA_1$ are abelian.
\end{lem}

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:triv-clone-implies-abelian}
If $\Clo(\bA)$ is trivial (i.e., generated by the projections),
then $\bA$ is abelian.
\end{lem}

%% \begin{lem}\label{lem:M3-abelian}

\subsection{Alternative development}
Here is the development of similar notions from Hobby and McKenzie~\cite[Ch.~3]{HM:1988}.
Let $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$ be congruences of an algebra $\bA$.
We use the formula $\sansC(\alpha, \beta; \delta)$
(in words, $\alpha$ centralizes $\beta$ modulo $\delta$) as an abbreviation for the
following property: For every $n > 1$, for every $f \in \Pol_n(\bA)$,
for all $(u,v)\in \alpha$, and for all $(x_i, y_i)\in \beta$ $(1< i<n)$, 
the following equivalence holds:
