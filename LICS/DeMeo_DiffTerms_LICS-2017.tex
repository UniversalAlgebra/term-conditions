\documentclass[proceedings,10pt]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

We consider the following practical question: given a finite algebra $\bA$ in a finite language, can we efficiently decide whether the variety generated by $\bA$ has a difference term?  We answer a related but easier question in the idempotent case. Using recent work of Valeriote and Willard as a guide, we define a ``local difference term'' and use this to prove a new theorem that yields a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether any finite idempotent algebra has a difference term operation.  We hope this will lead to an efficient algorithm for determining whether the variety generated by such an algebra has a difference term.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% no \IEEEPARstart

Let $\sV$ be a variety (equational class) of algebras.
A ternary term $d$ in the language of $\sV$ is called 
a \defn{difference term for $\sV$} if it satisfies the following:
for all $\bA = \<A, \dots \> \in \sV$ and $a, b \in A$ we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}  
d^{\bA}(a,a,b) = b \quad \text{ and } \quad
d^{\bA}(a,b,b) \comm \theta \theta a,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is any congruence %% of $\bA$
containing $(a,b)$
and $[\cdot, \cdot]$ denotes the (term condition) commutator.
(See~\cite{HM:1988} or~\cite{MR3076179} for definitions.)
When the relations in (\ref{eq:3}) hold we will call $d^{\bA}$
a \defn{difference term operation} for $\bA$.


Difference terms are studied extensively in the universal algebra literature.
(See, for example, \cite{HM:1988,MR1358491,MR3076179,MR1663558,MR3449235,KSW}.)
There are many reasons to study difference terms, but
one of the most obvious is that knowing a variety 
has a difference term allows us to deduce many useful
properties of the algebras inhabiting that variety.
(Very roughly speaking, having a difference term is slightly stronger than having
a Taylor term and slightly weaker than having a Mal'tsev term.
Note that if
$\bA$ is an \defn{abelian} algebra---that is, $[1_A, 1_A] = 0_A$---then by
the monotonicity of the commutator we have
$[\theta, \theta] = 0_A$ for all $\theta \in \Con \bA$, in which case
(\ref{eq:3}) says that $d^{\bA}$ is a Mal'tsev term operation.)

Digital computers have turned out to be invaluable tools for exploring and
understanding algebras and the varieties they inhabit, and this is largely due
to the fact that researchers have found ingenious ways
to get computers to solve abstract decision problems---such as
whether a variety is 
congruence-modular (\cite{Freese:2009}) or
congruence-$n$-permutable (\cite{MR3239624})---and to do so efficiently.
%% , in a way that scales well with problem size.
The contribution of the present paper is to report progress 
toward a solution to the following:
%% Difference terms are studied extensively in the general algebra literature.
%% See, for example, 
%% Roughly speaking, having a difference term is slightly stronger than having

\begin{problem}
  \label{prob:1}
  Is there a polynomial-time algorithm that takes a finite
  idempotent algebra $\bA$ as input and decides whether the variety generated by
  $\bA$ has a difference term?
\end{problem}
We solve the following easier problem:

  idempotent algebra $\bA$ as input and decides whether 
  $\bA$ has a difference term operation?

%% Let $\bp = (p_0, p_1, \dots, p_n)$ be an $(n+1)$-tuple of ternary terms, where
%% $p_0(x,y,z) \approx x$ and $p_n(x,y,z) \approx z$, the first and third
%% ternary projections, respectively. 
%% Let $\bA=\< A, \dots\>$ be an algebra.
In~\cite{MR3239624},
Valeriote and Willard define %% an \defn{$\bA$-triple for $\bp$}
%% to be a triple $(a,b,i)$ such that $a, b \in A$ and
%% $p_i(a,b,b) = p_{i+1}(a,a,b)$. They use this to define 
a ``local Hagemann-Mitschke sequence'' which they use as the basis of
an efficient algorithm for deciding for a given $n$ whether an idempotent
variety is $n$-permutable. 
Inspired by that work, we devise a similar construct, called
a ``local difference term,'' that we use to develop a polynomial-time
algorithm for deciding the existence of a (global) difference term operation.

\section{Local Difference Terms}


%% \input{../notes/inputs/loc-diff-term.tex}

For the most part we use standard notation, definitions, and
results of universal algebra, such as those found in~\cite{MR2839398}.
However, we make a few exceptions for notational simplicity.
For example, if $\bA =\<A, \dots\>$ is an algebra with elements 
$a, b \in A$, then we use $\theta(a,b)$ to denote
the congruence of $\bA$ generated by $a$ and $b$.

Let $\bA=\< A, \dots\>$ be an algebra, fix $a, b \in A$ and
$i \in \{0,1\}$.
%% An \defn{$\bA$-local difference term for
A \defn{local difference term for
  $(a,b,i)$} is a ternary term $p$ satisfying the following:
\begin{align}
%% \text{ if $i=0$, then } & a \comm{\Cg^{\bA}(a,b)}{\Cg^{\bA}(a,b)} p(a,b,b); \label{eq:diff-triple}\\
\text{ if $i=0$, then } & a \comm{\Cg(a,b)}{\Cg(a,b)} p(a,b,b); \label{eq:diff-triple}\\
\text{ if $i=1$, then } &p(a,a,b) = b. \nonumber
\end{align}
%% We often drop the
%% $\bA$ when the algebra is clear from context.
%% For example, we write $\Cg$ in place of $\Cg^{\bA}$, and 
%% call the term $p$ above a local difference term for 
%% $(a,b,i)$.
If $p$ satisfies~(\ref{eq:diff-triple}) for all triples
in some subset $S\subseteq A \times A \times \{0,1\}$, then we call $p$
a \defn{local difference term for $S$}.

Let 
$\sS = A \times A \times \{0,1\}$ and
suppose that every pair
$((a_0, b_0, \chi_0), (a_1, b_1, \chi_1))$
in $\sS^2$ has a local difference term.
That is, for each pair $((a_0, b_0, \chi_0), (a_1, b_1, \chi_1))$, there exists
$p$ such that for each $i \in \{0,1\}$ we have
\begin{align}
  a_i \comm{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}{\Cg(a_i,b_i)} p(a_i,b_i,b_i), & \;
  \text{ if $\chi_i=0$, and }  \label{eq:d-trip-i1}\\
  p(a_i,a_i,b_i) =b_i, & \;
  \text{ if $\chi_i=1$.}\label{eq:d-trip-i2} %\\\nonumber
\end{align}
Under these hypothesis we will prove that every subset $S\subseteq \sS$
has a local difference term.
That is, there is a single term $p$ that works (i.e., satisfies
(\ref{eq:d-trip-i1}) and (\ref{eq:d-trip-i2})) for all $(a_i, b_i, \chi_i) \in S$.
The statement and proof of this new result follows.

\begin{thm}[\protect{cf.~\cite[Theorem 2.2]{MR3239624}}]
  \label{thm:local-diff-terms}
  Let $\sV$ be an idempotent variety and
  $\bA \in \sV$. Define
  $\sS= A \times A \times \{0,1\}$
  and suppose that every pair
  $((a_0, b_0, \chi_0), (a_1, b_1, \chi_1)) \in \sS^2$
  has a local difference term.
  Then every subset $S \subseteq \sS$,
  has a local difference term.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The proof is by induction on the size of $S$.  In the base case, $|S| = 2$,
the claim holds by assumption.
Fix $n>2$ and assume that every subset of $\sS$ of size $2\leq k \leq n$ has a local
difference term. Let
$S = \{(a_0, b_0, \chi_0), (a_1, b_1, \chi_1), \dots, (a_{n}, b_{n},\chi_{n})\} \subseteq \sS$,
so that $|S| = n+1$.  We prove $S$ has a local difference term.

Since $|S| \geq 3$ and $\chi_i \in \{0,1\}$ for all $i$, there must exist
indices $i\neq j$ such that $\chi_i = \chi_j$. Assume without loss of generality
that one of these indices is $j=0$.  Define
the set
$S' = S \setminus \{(a_0, b_0, \chi_0)\}$.
Since $|S'| < |S|$, the set $S'$ has a local difference term $p$.
We split the remainder of the proof into two cases. In the first case
$\chi_0 = 0$ and in the second
$\chi_0 = 1$.

%--------------------------------------
\noindent \underline{Case 1:} $\chi_0 = 0$.
%% \\[4pt]
%% Assume $\chi_0 = 0$ and, 
%% w
Without loss of generality, suppose that $\chi_1 = %% \chi_2 =
\cdots =\chi_k = 1$,
and $\chi_{k+1} %% = \chi_{k+2} 
= \cdots = \chi_{n} = 0$. Define %% $T$ to be the set
$T = \{(a_0, p(a_0, b_0, b_0), 0),
(a_1, b_1, 1), (a_2, b_2, 1), 
\dots, (a_k, b_k, 1)\}$, and 
note that $|T| < |S|$.
Let $t$ be a local difference term for $T$.
Define
\[
d(x,y,z) = t(x, p(x,y,y), p(x,y,z)).
\]
Since $\chi_0 =0$, we need to show
$(a_0, d(a_0,b_0,b_0))$ belongs to $\comm{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}$.
We have
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:100000}
  d(a_0,b_0,b_0) =
  t(a_0, p(a_0,b_0,b_0), p(a_0,b_0,b_0))\comm{\tau}{\tau} a_0,
\end{equation}
where we have used $\tau$ to denote $\Cg(a_0, p(a_0,b_0,b_0))$.
Note that
%% \[(a_0, p(a_0,b_0,b_0)) = (p(a_0,a_0,a_0), p(a_0,b_0,b_0)) \in \Cg(a_0, b_0),\]
$(a_0, p(a_0,b_0,b_0)) = (p(a_0,a_0,a_0), p(a_0,b_0,b_0))$
belongs to $\Cg(a_0, b_0)$,
so $\tau\leq \Cg(a_0,b_0)$. Therefore,
by monotonicity of the commutator,
$\comm{\tau}{\tau} {\leq} \comm{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}$.
It follows from this and (\ref{eq:100000}) that
%% $d(a_0,b_0,b_0)\comm{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}{\Cg(a_0,b_0)} a_0$,
\[d(a_0,b_0,b_0)\comm{\Cg(a_0,b_0)}{\Cg(a_0,b_0)} a_0,\]
as desired.

For the indices $1\leq i \leq k$ we have $\chi_i =1$, so we wish to prove
$d(a_i,a_i,b_i) = b_i$ for such $i$. Observe,
\begin{align}
  d(a_i,a_i,b_i) &=
  t(a_i, p(a_i,a_i,a_i), p(a_i,a_i,b_i)) \label{eq:200000}\\
  &=t(a_i, a_i, b_i) \label{eq:200001}\\
  &=b_i. \label{eq:200002}
\end{align}
Equation~(\ref{eq:200000}) holds by definition of $d$,~(\ref{eq:200001})
because $p$ is an idempotent local difference term for
$S'$, and~(\ref{eq:200002}) because $t$ is a local difference term for $T$.

The remaining triples in our original set $S$
have indices satisfying $k<j\leq n$ and $\chi_j = 0$.
Thus, for these triples we want
$d(a_j,b_j,b_j)\comm{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}{\Cg(a_j,b_j)} a_j$.
By definition,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:450000}
d(a_j,b_j,b_j) =t(a_j, p(a_j,b_j,b_j), p(a_j,b_j,b_j)).  
\end{equation}
Since $p$ is a local difference term for $S'$, we have
%% the pair $(p(a_j,b_j,b_j), a_j)$ belongs to $[\Cg(a_j,b_j), \Cg(a_j,b_j)]$.
\[
(p(a_j,b_j,b_j), a_j)\in [\Cg(a_j,b_j), \Cg(a_j,b_j)].
\]
This and 
(\ref{eq:450000}) imply
%% \begin{equation*}
%%     %% \label{eq:300000}
%%   d(a_j,b_j,b_j) =
%%   t(a_j, p(a_j,b_j,b_j), p(a_j,b_j,b_j))
%%   \comm{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}{\Cg(a_j,b_j)} t(a_j,a_j,a_j) = a_j,
%% \end{equation*}
that 
%% $(t(a_j, p(a_j,b_j,b_j), p(a_j,b_j,b_j)), t(a_j,a_j,a_j))$
$(d(a_j, b_j,b_j), t(a_j,a_j,a_j))$
belongs to
$\comm{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}$.
Finally, by idempotence of $t$ we have
$d(a_j,b_j,b_j)\comm{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}{\Cg(a_j,b_j)} a_j$,
%% \begin{align*}
%%     %% \label{eq:300000}
%%   d(a_j,b_j,b_j) &=
%%   t(a_j, p(a_j,b_j,b_j), p(a_j,b_j,b_j))\\
%%   &\comm{\Cg(a_j,b_j)}{\Cg(a_j,b_j)} t(a_j,a_j,a_j)\\
%%   &= a_j,
%% \end{align*}
as desired.
\\[6pt]
%--------------------------------------
\underline{Case 2:}
$\chi_0 = 1$.
%% \\[4pt]
%% Assume $\chi_0 = 1$ and, 
Without loss of generality, suppose $\chi_1 = \chi_2 =\cdots =\chi_k = 0$,
and $\chi_{k+1} = \chi_{k+2} = \cdots = \chi_{n} = 1$. Define $T$ to be the set
\[
\{(p(a_0, a_0, b_0), b_0, 1),
(a_1, b_1, 0), (a_2, b_2 0), \dots, (a_k, b_k, 0)\},
\]
and note that $|T| < |S|$.
Let $t$ be a local difference term for $T$ and
define
%% \[d(x,y,z) = t(p(x,y,z), p(y,y,z), z).\] 
$d(x,y,z) = t(p(x,y,z), p(y,y,z), z)$. 
Since $\chi_0 =1$, we want $d(a_0,a_0,b_0) = b_0$. By the definition of
$d$,
\begin{equation*}
  d(a_0,a_0,b_0) =
  t(p(a_0,a_0,b_0), p(a_0,a_0,b_0), b_0) =b_0.
\end{equation*}
The last equality holds since $t$ is a local difference term for $T$, thus,
for $(p(a_0, a_0, b_0), b_0, 1)$.

If $1\leq i \leq k$, then $\chi_i =0$, so for these indices we want
$d(a_i,b_i,b_i) \comm{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}{\Cg(a_i,b_i)} a_i$.
Again, starting from the definition of $d$ and using idempotence of $p$, we have
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \label{eq:40000}
%%   d(a_i,b_i,b_i) =
%%   t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), p(b_i,b_i,b_i), b_i)=
%%   t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), b_i, b_i).
%% \end{equation}
\begin{align}
  d(a_i,b_i,b_i) &=
  t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), p(b_i,b_i,b_i), b_i)   \label{eq:40000}\\
  &=t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), b_i, b_i). \nonumber
\end{align}
Next, since $p$ is a local difference term for $S'$, we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:50000}
  t(p(a_i,b_i,b_i), b_i, b_i)
 \comm{\theta(a_i,b_i)}{\theta(a_i,b_i)}
 t(a_i, b_i, b_i).
\end{equation}
Finally, since $t$ is a local difference term for $T$, hence for
$(a_i, b_i, b_i)$,  %% $(1\leq i \leq k)$,
we have 
$t(a_i, b_i, b_i) \comm{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}{\Cg(a_i,b_i)} a_i$.
Combining this with (\ref{eq:40000}) and (\ref{eq:50000}) yields
\[
d(a_i,b_i,b_i) \comm{\Cg(a_i,b_i)}{\Cg(a_i,b_i)} a_i,
\]
as desired.

The remaining elements of our original set $S$
have indices $j$ satisfying $k<j\leq n$ and $\chi_j = 1$.
For these we want $d(a_j,a_j,b_j) = b_j$.
Since $p$ is a local difference term for $S'$, we have
$p(a_j,a_j,b_j) = b_j$, and this along with idempotence of $t$ yields
%%\[ d(a_j,a_j,b_j) =  t(p(a_j,a_j,b_j), p(a_j,a_j,b_j), b_j)=  t(b_j, b_j, b_j) =b_j,\]
\begin{align*}
d(a_j,a_j,b_j) &=
t(p(a_j,a_j,b_j), p(a_j,a_j,b_j), b_j)\\
&=t(b_j, b_j, b_j) =b_j,
\end{align*}
as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
  \label{cor:loc-diff-term}
  A finite idempotent algebra $\bA$ has a difference term operation if and
  only if every pair $((a,b,i), (a',b',i')) \in (A\times A \times \{0,1\})^2$ has a local
  difference term.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  One direction is clear, since a difference term operation for $\bA$ is
  obviously a local difference term for the whole set 
  $A\times A \times \{0,1\}$.
  For the converse, suppose
  each pair in $(A\times A \times \{0,1\})^2$ has a local
  difference term. Then, by Theorem~\ref{thm:local-diff-terms},
  there is a single local difference term for the whole set $A\times A \times \{0,1\}$,
  and this is a difference term operation for $\bA$.  Indeed, if $d$ is a
  local difference term for $A\times A \times \{0,1\}$, then 
  for all $a, b \in A$, we have
  $a \comm{\Cg(a,b)}{\Cg(a,b)} d(a,b,b)$,
  since $d$ is a local difference term for $(a,b,0)$, and we have
  $d(a,a,b) = b$, since $d$ is also a local difference term for
  $(a,b,1)$.
\end{proof}

\section{The Algorithm}
\begin{cor}
  There is a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input
  any finite idempotent algebra $\bA$ and decides whether
  %% the variety $\bbV(\bA)$ that it generates
  $\bA$ has a difference term operation.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
  %% and let  $\sV = \bbV(\bA)$.
  We describe an efficient algorithm for deciding,
  given a finite idempotent algebra $\bA$,
  whether every pair $((a,b,i), (a',b',i')) \in (A\times A \times \{0,1\})^2$ has a local
  difference term.  By Corollary~\ref{cor:loc-diff-term}, this will prove we
  can decide in polynomial-time whether $\bA$ has a difference term operation.
  %% We will then complete the
  %% proof by explaining why $\bA$ has a difference term operation iff the variety
  %% it generates has a difference term. 

  Fix a pair
  $((a,b,i), (a',b',i'))$ in $(A\times A \times \{0,1\})^2$. If $i = i' = 0$,
  then the first projection is a local difference term. If $i = i' = 1$,  
    then the third projection is a local difference term. The two remaining cases to
    consider are (1) $i = 0$ and $i'=1$, and (2)
    $i = 1$ and $i'=0$. Since these are completely symmetric, we only handle the
    first case. Assume  the given pair of triples is
    $((a,b,0), (a',b',1))$.  By definition, a term $t$ is local difference term
    for this pair iff
    \[
    a\comm{\Cg(a,b)}{\Cg(a,b)} t^{\bA}(a,b,b) \; \text{ and } \;
    t^{\bA}(a',a',b') = b'.
    \]
    We can rewrite this condition more compactly by
    considering 
    $t^{\bA\times \bA}((a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b')) =
    (t^{\bA}(a,b,b),t^{\bA}(a',a',b'))$.
    Clearly $t$ is a local difference term for
    $((a,b,0), (a',b',1))$ iff
    \[
    t^{\bA\times \bA}((a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b'))\in a/\delta \times \{b'\},
    \]
    where $\delta = [\Cg(a,b), \Cg(a,b)]$ and $a/\delta$ denotes the
    $\delta$-class containing $a$.
    (Observe that $a/\delta \times \{b'\}$ is a subalgebra of $\bA \times \bA$
    by idempotence.)
    It follows that the pair
    $((a,b,0), (a',b',1))$ has a local difference term iff
    the subuniverse of $\bA\times \bA$ generated by
    $\{(a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b')\}$ intersects nontrivially with the subuniverse
    $a/\delta \times \{b'\}$.

    Thus, the algorithm takes as input $\bA$ and, for each triple
    $((a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b'))$ in $(A\times A)^3$, computes
    $\delta = [\Cg(a,b), \Cg(a,b)]$, computes the subalgebra
    $\bS$ of $\bA\times \bA$ generated by
    %% \Sg^{\bA\times \bA}\{(a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b')\}$, and then
    $\{(a,a'), (b,a'), (b,b')\}$, and then
    tests whether $S \cap (a/\delta \times \{b'\})$ is empty.
    If we find an empty intersection at any point, then the algorithm returns
    the answer ``no difference term operation.'' Otherwise,
    $\bA$ has a difference term operation.

    Most of the operations carried out by this algorithm are well known to be
    polynomial-time.  For example, that the running time of subalgebra generation is
    polynomial has been known for a long time (see~\cite{MR0455543}).
    The time complexity of congruence generation is also known to be polynomial
    (see~\cite{MR2470585}).  The only operation whose tractability might be 
    questionable is the commutator, but there is a straight-forward algorithm for
    computing it which, after the congruences have been computed, simply
    involves generating more subalgebras.
    %% Finally, we observe that if $\bA$ has a difference term operation, then the
    %% variety it generates has a difference term.
\end{proof}

More details on the complexity of operations carried out by the algorithm, as well as many other algebraic operations, can be found in the references mentioned, as well as~\cite{MR1871085,MR1695293,Freese:2009}.
