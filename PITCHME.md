## The Problem

- Can we efficiently decide whether a finite algebra $\mathbf{A}$ generates a variety with a difference term? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- We will outline the proof that the answer is "yes." <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Time permitting, we will describe an algorithm for constructing difference terms. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Definitions

A <a style="color:#e7ad52"><i>difference term</i></a> for $\mathcal{V}$ is a term $d$ satisfying,
  
for all $\mathbf A = \langle A, \dots \rangle \in \mathcal V$ and all $a, b \in A$, 

$$d(a,a,b) = b \quad \text{ and } \quad
d(a,b,b) \mathrel{[\theta, \theta]} a$$

where $\theta$ is any congruence containing $(a,b)$ and $[\cdot, \cdot]$ is the <a style="color:#e7ad52"><i>commutator</i></a>.

Note: 
When the relations above hold we call $d^{\mathbf{A}}$ a **difference term operation** for $\mathbf{A}$.

Note: 
We make colors <span class="fragment highlight-red">like this</span>

## Problem Statement

Is there a poly-time algorithm that takes a finite
idempotent algebra $\mathbf{A}$ and decides 
whether $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ has a difference term?

**Theorem** (Kearnes *J Algebra* 1995)   
$\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ has a diff term
$\Leftrightarrow$  $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ omits 1's and type 2 tails

Omitting 1's is poly-time decidable by Valeriote's subtype theorem.

**Reduced Problem**   
Is there a poly-time algorithm that takes a finite 
idempotent algebra $\mathbf{A}$ and decides whether 
$\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ has nonempty type 2 tails?

## A Related Problem

**Theorem** (Freese, Valeriote *IJAC* 2009)  
  There is a poly-time algorithm that takes a finite
  idempotent algebra $\mathbf{A}$ and decides whether $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ is 
  <a style="color:#e7ad52">*congruence-modular*</a>.

**Proof Idea**
  + Congruence-modularity is characterized by omitting 1's, 5's, and tails. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  + Omitting 1's and 5's is poly-time decidable by the subtype theorem. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  + If there is a tail in $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$, then there is a tail "near the bottom". <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## What is "near the bottom"?

**Theorem.** Let $\mathbf{A}$ be a finite idempotent algebra and $T$ an order ideal in the lattice of types. Then $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ omits $T$ iff $\mathsf{S}(\mathbf{A})$ does.
  
For example, $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ omits $\{1, 5\}$ iff $\mathsf{S}(\mathbf{A})$ does.

*Freese and Valeriote prove:*  
If $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ omits $\{1, 5\}$, then nontrivial tails occur in $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf{A})$ only if they occur in 3-generated subalgebras of $\mathbf{A}^2$.

---

## Main Theorem

- Suppose $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf A)$ omits type 1 and contains a finite algebra $\mathbf{B}$ with a type 2 prime quotient $\alpha \prec \beta$ such that the $\langle \alpha, \beta \rangle$-minimal sets have non-empty tails. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Then there exists a 3-generated subalgebra of $\mathbf A \times \mathbf A$
  with this property. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- **Conclusion:** to check for type 2 tails in $\mathbb{V}(\mathbf A)$, it suffices to look for them in 3-generated subalgebras of $\mathbf A \times \mathbf A$. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Proof Strategy

- WLOG $\mathbf{B}$ is a subdirect product of a finite subcollection of $\mathcal S$. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Choose $n$ minimal such that for some $\mathbf{A}_0$, $\dots$, $\mathbf{A}_{n-1}$ in $\mathcal S$, there exists $\mathbf{B} \leq_{sd} \prod_{[n]} \mathbf{A}_i$ with a prime quotient of type 2 whose minimal sets have tails. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Assuming $n > 1$, we prove that $n = 2$. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

- For this $n$, select the $\mathbf{A}_i$ and $\mathbf{B}$ so that $|B|$ is as small as possible. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Let $\alpha \prec \beta$ be a prime quotient of $\mathbf{B}$ of type~2 such that its minimal sets have non-empty tails, and choose $\beta$ minimal with this property. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- By HM, this implies $\beta$ is join irreducible and $\alpha$ is its unique subcover. Let $U$ be an $(\alpha, \beta)$-minimal set. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Lemma 3.1

If $0$, $1 \in U$ such that $(0,1) \in \beta - \alpha$ and
$t$ be a member of the tail of $U$. Then $\beta$ is the 
congruence of $\mathbf{B}$
generated by the pair $(0,1)$ and $\mathbf{B}$ is generated 
by $\{0, 1, t\}$.

---

For $i \leq n$, let $\rho_i$ 
denote the kernel of the projection of $\mathbf{B}$ onto $\mathbf{A}_i$,
so $\mathbf{B} \cong \mathbf{A}_i/\rho_i$.
For a subset $\sigma \subseteq [n]$, define

$\rho_\sigma := \bigwedge_{j\in \sigma} \rho_j.$

Consequently,

$\rho_{[n]} = \bigwedge_{j\in [n]}\rho_j = 0_{B}$

By minimality of $n$ we know that the intersection of any  proper subset of the $\rho_i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$ is strictly above $0_B$.  Thus, $0_B < \rho_\sigma < 1_B$ for all $\emptyset \subset \sigma\subset [n]$
(by $\subset$ we mean \emph{proper} subset).

---

## Lemma 3.2
  For every proper nonempty subset $\sigma \subset [n]$,
  either $\beta \leq \rho_\sigma$ or $\alpha \vee \rho_\sigma = 1_B$.

## Near Permutability Lemma

For all $\sigma \subset [n]$, all $v\in B$, and all $c\in body(U)$, we have
\begin{equation*}(v,c) \in \beta \circ \rho_\sigma \cap \rho_\sigma \circ \beta.\end{equation*}

## Lemma 3.3

1. There exists $0 \leq i < n$ such that $\alpha \vee \rho_i = 1_B$

2. There exists $i$ such that $\alpha \vee \rho_i < 1_B$.

---

## Theorem 3.4

Let $\mathcal V$ be the variety generated by some finite set $\mathcal S$ of finite,
idempotent algebras that is closed under taking subalgebras. If $\mathcal V$
omits type 1 and some finite member of $\mathcal V$ has a prime quotient 
of type 2 whose minimal sets have non-empty tails, then there is some
3-generated algebra $\mathbf{B}$ with this property that belongs to $\mathcal S$ or 
is a subdirect product of two algebras from $\mathcal S$.
