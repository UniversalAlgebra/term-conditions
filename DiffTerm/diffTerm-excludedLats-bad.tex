\begin{abstract}
We consider the following practical question: given a finite 
algebra $\alg{A}$ in a
finite language, can we efficiently decide whether the variety 
generated by $\alg{A}$
has a difference term?  We answer this question in the idempotent case
and then describe possible algorithms for constructing difference terms.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

A \defn{difference term} for a variety $\sV$ is a ternary term $d$ in the
language of $\sV$ that satisfies the following:
if $\alg{A} = \<A, \dots \> \in \sV$, then for all $a, b \in A$ we have
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:3}  
d^{\alg{A}}(a,a,b) = b \quad \text{ and } \quad
d^{\alg{A}}(a,b,b) \comm \theta \theta a,
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is any congruence %% of $\alg{A}$
containing $(a,b)$
and $[\cdot, \cdot]$ denotes the \defn{commutator}.
%% (see Section~\ref{sec:defin-notat}).
When the relations in (\ref{eq:3}) hold we call $d^{\alg{A}}$
a \defn{difference term operation} for $\alg{A}$.

Difference terms are studied extensively in the general algebra literature.
(See, for example, \cite{MR1358491,MR1663558,MR3076179,KSW,MR3449235}.)
There are many reasons to study difference terms, but
one obvious reason is because if we know that a variety 
has a difference term, this fact allows us to deduce many useful
properties of the algebras inhabiting that variety.
Very roughly speaking, having a difference term is slightly stronger than having
a Taylor term and slightly weaker than having a Mal'cev term.
(Note that if
$\alg{A}$ is an \defn{abelian} algebra, which means 
that $[1_A, 1_A] = 0_A$, then, by
the monotonicity of the commutator,
$[\theta, \theta] = 0_A$ for all $\theta \in \Con \alg{A}$, 
in which case $\textbf{A}$
(\ref{eq:3}) says that $d^{\alg{A}}$ is a Mal'tsev term operation.)

Digital computers have turned out to be invaluable tools for exploring and
understanding algebras and the varieties they inhabit, and this is largely due
to the fact that, over the last three decades,
researchers have found ingenious ways to get computers to
solve challenging abstract decision problems---such as whether a variety is
congruence $n$-permutable (\cite{MR3239624}), or
congruence modular (\cite{Freese:2009})---and to do so very quickly.
This paper contributes to this effort by finding an efficient
algorithm for deciding whether a locally finite idempotent variety has a
difference term.

The central question motivating this project is the following:
\begin{prob}
  \label{prob:1}
  Is there a polynomial-time algorithm to decide for a finite,
  idempotent algebra $\alg{A}$ if $\bbV(\alg{A})$ has a difference term.
\end{prob}
Kearnes proved in~\cite{MR1358491} that $\alg{A}$ has a difference term iff
$\bbV(\alg{A})$ has a Taylor term and no type-2 tails
(equivalently, $\bbV(\alg{A})$ has no 1's and no type-2 tails).
No 1's is poly-time decidable by Valeriote's subtype theorem.
In~\cite{Freese:2009}, Freese and Valeriote solved an analogous problem, by
giving a positive answer to the following
\begin{prob}
  \label{prob:2}
  Is there a polynomial-time algorithm to decide for a finite,
  idempotent algebra $\alg{A}$ if $\bbV(\alg{A})$ is \ac{cm}?
\end{prob}

Congruence modularity is characterized by no 1's, no 5's and no tails.
Again no 1's and no 5's can be decided by the subtype theorem,
and in~\cite{Freese:2009} the authors prove that if there is
a tail in $\bbV(\alg{A})$, there is a tail ``near the bottom.''
More precisely, if $\alg{A}$ is finite and idempotent, and $\bbV(\alg{A})$ has no
1's and no 5's and has tails, then there is a tail in a 3-generated subalgebra of $\alg{A}^2$.
Using this it is proved that deciding \cm is polynomial-time.

But the proof of the no tails part uses that in a variety with no 1's or 5's,
the congruence lattice modulo the {\it solvability congruence} (defined below)
is (join) semidistributive.
Now, restricting to just testing no type-2 tails (vs no tails of any type) is
not a problem. So, for example, there is a poly-time algorithm for testing if
$\bbV(\alg{A})$ has no 1's, no 5's and no type-2 tails.  

Here is a related problem.
\begin{prob}

\section{Background, definitions, and notation}
\label{sec:defin-notat}
Our starting point is the set of lemmas at the beginning of Section 3 in
the Freese-Valeriote paper~\cite{Freese:2009}.
We first review some of the basic \ac{tct}
that comes up in the proofs in that paper. (In fact, most of this section 
is copied from the nice presentation of \tct background that appears
in~\cite[Sec.~2]{Freese:2009}.)

The reference for \tct is the book by Hobby and McKenzie
\cite{HM:1988}, according to which,
for each covering $\alpha \prec \beta$ in the congruence lattice of a finite
algebra $\alg{A}$, the local behavior of the $\beta$-classes is captured by the
so-called $(\alpha, \beta)$-traces~\cite[Def.~2.15]{HM:1988}.
Modulo $\alpha$, the induced structure on the traces is limited to one
of five possible types:

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item unary algebra whose basic operations are all permutations (unary type);
\item one-dimensional vector space over some finite field (affine type);
\item 2-element boolean algebra (boolean type);
\item 2-element lattice (lattice type);
\item 2-element semilattice (semilattice type).
\end{enumerate}

Thus to each covering $\alpha \prec \beta$
corresponds a ``\tct type'' in $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ (see~\cite[Def.~5.1]{HM:1988}),
denoted by $\typ(\alpha, \beta)$, called the \emph{typeset} of $\alg{A}$.
The set of all \tct types that are realized by covering pairs of congruences of a
finite algebra $\alg{A}$ is denoted by $\typ\{\alg{A}\}$, and if $\sK$ is a class of algebras,
then $\typ\{\sK\}$ denotes the union of the typesets of all finite algebras in $\sK$.
\tct types are ordered according to the following ``lattice of types:''

\newcommand{\dotsize}{0.8pt}
%% To create nodes of lattices in a uniform and consistent way, we define
\tikzstyle{lat} = [circle,draw,inner sep=\dotsize]
% To scale all diagrams uniformly, change this setting:
\begin{center}
\newcommand{\figscale}{.7}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=\figscale]
  \scalefont{.8}
  \node[lat] (1) at (0,0) {};
  \node[lat] (2) at (-1,1.5) {};
  \node[lat] (3) at (0,3) {};
  \node[lat] (4) at (.8,2.1) {};
  \node[lat] (5) at (.8,.9) {};
  \draw (1) node [below] {$1$};
  \draw (2) node [left] {$2$};
  \draw (3) node [above] {$3$};
  \draw (4) node [right] {$4$};
  \draw (5) node [right] {$5$};
  \draw[semithick] 
  (1) -- (2) -- (3) -- (4) -- (5) -- (1);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Whether or not $\bbV(\alg{A})$ omits one of the order ideals of the lattice of types can be
determined locally.  This is spelled out for us in the next proposition.
(A \defn{strictly simple} algebra is a simple
algebra with no non-trivial subalgebras.)
%% ; i.e.~no proper subalgebras with
%% more than one element.)


\begin{prop}[Prop.~2.1~\cite{Freese:2009}]
  \label{prop:2.1}
If A is a finite idempotent algebra and $i \in \typ(\bbV(\alg{A}))$ then there
is a finite strictly simple algebra $\bS$ of type $j$ for some $j \leq i$ in $\sansH \sansS (\alg{A})$.
If
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item 
  $j = 1$ then $\bS$ is term equivalent to a 2-element set;
\item
  $j = 2$ then $\bS$ is term equivalent to the idempotent reduct of a module;
\item
  $j = 3$ then $\bS$ is functionally complete;
\item
  $j = 4$ then $\bS$ is polynomially equivalent to a 2-element lattice;
\item
  $j = 5$ then $\bS$ is term equivalent to a 2-element semilattice.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  This is a combination of~\cite[Prop.~3.1]{MR2504025} and~\cite[Thm.~6.1]{MR1191235}.
\end{proof}

Table~\ref{tab:1} is from~\cite{MR3350327} and gives another characterization of
omitting types.

\section{The Freese-Valeriote Lemmas Revisited}
\label{sec:freese-valer-lemm}
In~\cite{Freese:2009}, Corollary~\ref{cor:2.2} is the starting point of the
development of a polynomial-time algorithm that determines if a given finite
idempotent algebra generates a \cm variety. 

%% The following lemma ties in with the previous proposition and will be used
%% in Sec. 6.
%% \begin{lemma}[Lemma 2.3~\cite{Freese:2009}] 
%%   Let $\alg{A}$ be a finite idempotent algebra and let $\bS \in \sansH \sansS(\alg{A})$
%%   be strictly simple. Then there are elements $a, b \in A$ such that, if
%%   $\alg{B} = \Sg^{\alg{A}} (a, b)$, then $1_B = \Cg^{\alg{B}} (a, b)$ and is join irreducible
%%   with unique lower cover $\rho$ such that $\bS = \alg{B}/\rho$.
%% \end{lemma}
%% \begin{proof}
%%   Choose $\alg{B} \in \sansS (\alg{A})$ as small as possible having $\bS$ as a homomorphic image,
%%   say $\bS = \alg{B}/\rho$. We claim that if $a, b \in B$ with
%%   $(a, b) \in \notin \rho$ then they generate $\alg{B}$. To
%%   see this, let $\alg{B}'= \Sg^{\alg{B}} (a, b)$ and let $h$ be the quotient map from B to S with kernel
%%   ρ. Then h(B  ) is a non-trivial subuniverse of S and so must equal S. Thus B  = B.
%%   Now let a, b ∈ B with (a, b) ∈
%%   / ρ. Since the block of Cg B (a, b) containing a
%%   and b is a subuniverse of B then from the previous paragraph, we conclude that
%%   Cg B (a, b) = 1 B and that ρ is its unique lower cover.
%% \end{proof}

According to the characterization
in~\cite[Ch.~8]{HM:1988} of locally finite congruence modular (resp.,
distributive) varieties, a finite algebra $\alg{A}$ generates a congruence modular
(resp., distributive) variety $\sV$ if and only if the typeset of $\sV$ is
contained in $\{2, 3, 4\}$ (resp., $\{3, 4\}$) and all minimal sets of prime
quotients of finite algebras in $\sV$ have empty
tails~\cite[Def.~2.15]{HM:1988}. Note that in the distributive 
case the empty tails condition is equivalent to the minimal sets all having exactly
two elements.

It follows from Corollary~\ref{cor:2.2} and Proposition~\ref{prop:2.1}
that if $\alg{A}$ is idempotent then one can
test the first condition, on omitting types 1 and 5 (or 1, 2, and 5) by searching
for a 2-generated subalgebra of $\alg{A}$ whose typeset is not contained in
$\{2, 3, 4\}$ ($\{3, 4\}$). It is proved in~\cite[Sec.~6]{Freese:2009} that this
test can be performed in polynomial time---that is, the running time of the test
is bounded by a polynomial function of the size of $\alg{A}$.
In~\cite[Sec.~3]{Freese:2009}, Freese and Valeriote prove a sequence of
lemmas to establish that, if $\alg{A}$ is finite and idempotent, and if
$\mathcal V = \bbV(\alg{A})$ omits types 1 and 5, then to test for the existence of tails
in $\sV$ it suffices to look for them 
in the 3-generated subalgebras of $\alg{A}^2$.
%% More specifically, the authors assume that the type set of $\bbV(\alg{A})$ contains no 1's
%% and no 5's, and under this 
%% assumption they prove that non-empty tails either do not occur in $\bbV(\alg{A})$,
%% or they occur in 3-generated subalgebras of $\alg{A}^2$.
In other words, either there are no non-empty tails
or else there are non-empty tails that are easy to find
(since they occur in 3-generated subalgebras of $\alg{A}^2$).
It follows that Problem~\ref{prob:2} has a positive answer:
deciding whether or not a finite idempotent algebra generates a congruence
modular variety is tractable.\footnote{That is, there are positive integers
  $C, n$, and an algorithm that takes
  a finite idempotent algebra $\alg{A}$ as input and decides
  in at most $C|\alg{A}|^n$ steps whether $\bbV(\alg{A})$ is congruence modular.
  Here $|\alg{A}|$ denotes the number of bits required to encode the algebra $\alg{A}$.}
%% polynomial-time algorithm to decide, for a finite idempotent algebra $\alg{A}$,
%% whether $\bbV(\alg{A})$ is congruence modular.}

Our goal is to use the same strategy to solve Problem~\ref{prob:1}.
As such, we revisit each lemma in Section 3 of \cite{Freese:2009},
and consider whether it can be proved under modified hypotheses.
Specifically, we continue to assume that the type set of $\bbV(\alg{A})$ contains no 1's,
but we will now drop the ``no 5's'' assumption.  We will attempt to prove that
either there are no \emph{type-2} tails in $\bbV(\alg{A})$, or else \emph{type-2}
tails can be found ``quickly,'' (e.g., in a 3-generated subalgebra of $\alg{A}^2$).
We continue to quote~\cite{Freese:2009} where possible,
while modifying the assumptions and adjusting the arguments as necessary.


Throughout, we let $\nn$ denote the set $\{0,1,\dots, n-1\}$ and 
(at least for the rest of this section) we let $\sS$ be a finite 
set of finite,
similar, idempotent algebras, closed under the taking of 
subalgebras, such that
$\sV = \bbV(\sS)$ omits 1 (but may include type 5).
If there is a finite algebra in $\sV$ having a type 2 minimal set 
having a tail, then, by standard tame congruence theory, there
is such an algebra which is a subalgebra of a product 
of elements
in $\sS$ have a type~2 minimal set with a tail. So we
suppose that some finite algebra
$\alg{B}$ in $\sV$ has a prime quotient whose minimal sets 
have non-empty
\emph{type-2} tails and show that there is a 3-generated 
subalgebra of the
product of two members of $\sS$ with this property.

Since $\sS$ is closed under the taking of subalgebras,
we may assume that the algebra $\alg{B}$ from the previous paragraph is a subdirect
product of a finite number of members of $\sS$. Choose $n$ minimal such that for
some $\alg{A}_0$, $\alg{A}_1$, $\dots$, $\alg{A}_{n-1}$ in $\sS$, there is a subdirect
product $\alg{B} \sdp \prod_{\nn} \alg{A}_i$
that has a prime quotient with non-empty type-2 tails.
Under the assumption that $n > 1$ we will attempt to prove that $n = 2$.

For this $n$, select the $\alg{A}_i$ and $\alg{B}$ so that $|B|$ is as small as possible.
Let $\alpha \prec \beta$ be a prime quotient of $\alg{B}$ with non-empty
type-2 tails and choose $\beta$ minimal with this property.
Let $U$ be an $(\alpha, \beta)$-minimal set and let $N$ be an
 $(\alpha, \beta)$-trace of $U$. Let 0 and 1 be
two distinct members of $N$ with $(0, 1) \notin \alpha$.

\begin{lemma}[{\protect cf.~\cite[Lem.~3.1]{Freese:2009}}]
  \label{lem:fv_3-1}
  Let $t$ be a member of the tail of $U$. Then $\beta$ is the congruence of $\alg{B}$
  generated by the pair $(0, 1)$ and $\alg{B}$ is generated by $\{0, 1, t\}$.
\end{lemma}
It seems the proof of~\cite[Lem.~3.1]{Freese:2009} goes through with only minor
adjustments. % to prove Lemma~\ref{lem:fv_3-1}.
\begin{proof}
  {\bf TODO:} fill in proof of  Lemma~\ref{lem:fv_3-1}.
\end{proof}


For $i \leq n$, let $\rho_i$ denote the kernel of the projection of $\alg{B}$ onto $\alg{A}_i$,
so $\alg{B} \cong \alg{A}_i/\rho_i$.
For a subset $\sigma \subseteq \nn$, define
\[
\rho_\sigma := \bigwedge_{j\in \sigma} \rho_j.
\]
Consequently,
$\rho_{\nn} = \bigwedge_{j\in \nn}\rho_j = 0_{B}$
%% \marginnote{wjd: I don't see why join in (3.1) is $1_B$... it's probably wrong.}[3cm]
%% \begin{equation}
%%   \label{eq:2}
%%   \rho_{\nn} = \bigwedge_{j\in \nn}\rho_j = 0_{B} \quad \text{ and } \quad
%%   \bigvee_{j\in \nn}\rho_j =1_B. %% \qquad
%% \end{equation}
By minimality of $n$ we know that the intersection of any  proper subset of the
$\rho_i$, $1 \leq i \leq n$ is strictly above $0_B$.  Thus,
$0_B < \rho_\sigma < 1_B$ for all 
$\emptyset \subset \sigma\subset \nn$
(by $\subset$ we mean \emph{proper} subset).

\begin{lemma}[{\protect cf.~\cite[Lem.~3.2]{Freese:2009}}]
  \label{lem:fv_3-2}
  If $\sigma \subset \nn$, then
  either $\beta \leq \rho_\sigma$ or $\alpha \join \rho_\sigma = 1_B$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  {\bf TODO:} fill in proof of  Lemma~\ref{lem:fv_3-2}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[{\protect cf.~\cite[Lem.~3.3]{Freese:2009}}]
  \label{lem:fv_3-3}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item \label{item:6} There exists $0\leq i< n $
      such that $\alpha \join \rho_i = 1_B$
    \item \label{item:7} There exists $i$ such that  
      $\alpha \join \rho_i < 1_B$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  %% {\bf TODO:} fill in proof of  Lemma~\ref{lem:fv_3-3}.
  %%\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
  %%\item %\label{item:6} There exists $0\leq i< n $  such that $\alpha \join \rho_i = 1_B$
If item \eqref{item:6} failed, then we would 
have $\beta \leq \rho_i$ for all $i$, and that
would imply $\beta = 0_B$.
  %%\item %\label{item:7} There exists $i$ such that $\alpha \join \rho_i < 1_B$.
  
To see \eqref{item:7}, assume
\begin{equation} \label{eq:4}
\alpha \join \rho_i = 1_B \; \text{ for all $i$.}
\end{equation}
Take a nonempty proper subset $\sigma \subset \nn$ of indices and let 
$\rho_\sigma = \bigwedge_{j\in \sigma} \rho_j$.
Then $\alpha \join \rho_\sigma = 1_B$ since otherwise,
by Lemma~\ref{lem:fv_3-2}, we have
$\alpha \leq \beta \leq \rho_\sigma \leq \rho_i$ for $i \in \sigma$, so
$\alpha \join \rho_i = \rho_i < 1_B$, contradicting (\ref{eq:4}).
Therefore, $\beta \join \rho_\sigma = 1_B$.

\smallskip

\noindent {\bf Subclaim:}
For all nonempty proper subsets $\sigma \subset \nn$,
for all $c\in \body(U)$ and all $v\in B$, we have
$(c, v) \in \beta \circ \rho_\sigma \cap \rho_\sigma \circ \beta$.

\smallskip
    
\noindent To prove the subclaim, we first note that 
$\beta \join \rho_\sigma = 1_B$ implies
$\restr{\beta}{U} \join \restr{\rho_\sigma}{U} = 1_U$ since $U = e(B)$.
Now, for all $x, y \in U$, if $x\in \body(U)$ and $y\in \tail(U)$, then
$(x,y) \notin \beta$.  Therefore,
$(x, y) \in  1_U = \restr{\beta}{U} \join \restr{\rho_\sigma}{U}$ implies
there must be some $a \in \body(U)$ and $t\in \tail(U)$ such that 
$a \mathrel{\rho_\sigma} t$.  

%%%%%%

%Let $b\in \body(U)$ be such that
%$(a,b) \in \restr{\beta}{U} - \restr{\alpha}{U}$.  

%By Lemma~\ref{lem:fv_3-1},
%$\alg{B} = \Sg^{\alg{B}}(a, b, t)$.
%Let $v \in B$. Then $v = s^{\alg{B}}(a,b,t)$ 
%for some (idempotent) term $s$, so
%\[
%v = s^{\alg{B}}(a,b,t)
%\mathrel{\rho_\sigma} s^{\alg{B}}(a,b,a)
%\mathrel{\beta} s^{\alg{B}}(a,a,a) = a,
%\]
%and
%\[
%v = s^{\alg{B}}(a,b,t)
%\mathrel{\beta}  s^{\alg{B}}(a,a,t)
%\mathrel{\rho_\sigma}s^{\alg{B}}(a,a,a)  = a.
%\]
%Therefore, 
%$(v,a) \in  \beta \circ \rho_\sigma \cap \rho_\sigma \circ \beta$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Now, let $d(x,y,z)$ be a pseudo-\malcev polynomial for $U$,
which exists by~\cite[Lem.~4.20]{HM:1988}.
Thus,
\begin{itemize}
\item $d(B,B,B) = U$
\item $d(x,x,x) = x$ for all $x\in U$
\item $d(x,x,y) = y = d(y,x,x)$ for all $x\in \body(U)$, $y \in U$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, for all $c, d \in \body(U)$, the unary polynomials
$d(x,c,d)$, $d(c,x,d)$, and $d(c,d,x)$ are permutations on $U$.

Now let $c$ be an arbitrary element of $\body(U)$, and
let $p(x) = d(x,a,c)$. 
Then (see~\cite[Lem.~4.20]{HM:1988})
we have $p(U) = U$, $p(a) = d(a,a,c) = c \in \body(U)$ 
and $p(t)\in \tail(U)$,
since $t\in \tail(U)$. Let $t' = p(t)$. 
Since $(a,t) \in \rho_\sigma$, we have
$(c, t') = (p(a), p(t)) \in \rho_\sigma$. 

Since $c$ is in the body, there is an element $d$ in the body with
$(c,d) \in \beta - \alpha$.
By Lemma~\ref{lem:fv_3-1},
$\alg{B} = \Sg^{\alg{B}}(c, d, t')$.
Let $v \in B$ be arbitrary. Then $v = s^{\alg{B}}(c,d,t')$ for 
some (idempotent) term $s$, so
\[
v = s^{\alg{B}}(c,d,t')
\mathrel{\rho_\sigma} s^{\alg{B}}(c,d,c)
\mathrel{\beta} s^{\alg{B}}(c,c,c) = c,
\]
and
\[
v = s^{\alg{B}}(c,d,t')
\mathrel{\beta}  s^{\alg{B}}(c,c,t')
\mathrel{\rho_\sigma}s^{\alg{B}}(c,c,c)  = c.
\]
Therefore, 
$(v,c) \in  \beta \circ \rho_\sigma \cap \rho_\sigma \circ \beta$,
proving the subclaim.


%We conclude from the foregoing that,
%for all nonempty proper subsets $\sigma \subset n$,
%for all $a\in \body(U)$ and all $v\in B$, we have
%$(a, v) \in \beta \circ \rho_\sigma \cap \rho_\sigma \circ \beta$, 
%proving the subclaim.

Let $b \in \body(U)$ and $t \in \tail(U)$. By
\cite[Lemma~4.25]{HM:1988}, $(b, d(b,t,t)) \notin \beta$.
We will arrive at a contradiction by showing that 
$b = d(b,t,t)$. By the claim $(b,t) \in \beta \circ \rho$ so
there is an element $a \in B$ with 
$b\mathrel\beta a \mathrel\rho_i t$. By applying the idempotent
polynomial $e$ with $e(U) = U$ to this, we may assume $a \in U$
and, since $a\mathrel \beta b$, $a \in \body(U)$. So
\[
d(b,t,t) \mathrel\rho_i d(b,a,a) = b.
\]
Since this hold for every~$i$, $d(b,t,t) = b$.
\end{proof}


%\begin{lemma}[{\protect cf.~\cite[Lem.~3.3]{Freese:2009}}]
%\label{lem:fv_3-3x}
%There is exactly one~$i$ such that $\beta \not\le \rho_i$.

%\begin{proof}
%If $n = 1$ then $\rho_1 = 0$ so the results holds. The lemma

\section{Excluded Lattices}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:conjecture}
Let $\alg A$ be a finite algebra with a Taylor term. Then 
$\Con(\alg{A})$ does not have congruences 
$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\rho_0, \ldots, \rho_{n-1}$
 satisfying
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$\rho_i \ne 1_{\alg A}$, for all $i$,
\item
$\Meet \rho_i = 0_{\alg A}$,
\item
$\beta$ is join irreducible,
\item 
$\alpha \cov \beta$ is a prime quotient of type 2, and
\item
$\alpha \join \rho_i = 1_{\alg A}$, for all $i$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
First note that it follows from (2), (3), and (4) that
\[
\{\rho_i\meet\beta, \alpha, \beta, \rho_i, 1_{\alg A}\}
\]
forms a pentagon, for each~$i$. 
Let $U$ be an $(\alpha, \beta)$-minimal set and 
let $e$ be an idempotent polynomial with $e(A) = U$. 
Then $e$ induces a lattice homomorphism of $\Con \alg A$ onto
$\Con \alg A |_{U}$ separating $\alpha$ from $\beta$, thus
leaving the pentagon intact. It 
follows that $U$ must have a tail, for otherwise, it would
be a type 2 minimal set with only body and the pseudo 
Maltsev operation would mean $\Con \alg A |_{U}$ is
modular, a contradiction.

A \emph{minority term} (for an algebra or variety) is a 
3-variable term $q(x,y,z)$ such if two of the variables
are equal, its value is the other one; that is, 
\[
q(x,x,y) \approx q(x,y,x) \approx q(y,x,x) \approx y.
\]
We are interested in an algebraic description of varieties having
a minority term. One possible conjecture is:
\begin{conjecture}
$\mathcal V$ has a minority term if and only if it is CP and its
ring has characteristic~1 or~2.
\end{conjecture}



\begin{fact}
If $\mathcal V$ has a minority term, then it is CP.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
Clearly a minority term is a Maltsev term.
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}
A CD variety $\mathcal V$ has a minority term if and
only if it is CP.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
A variety is CD and CP if and only if it has a Pixley term. 
If $p(x,y,z)$ is a Pixley term then 
\[
q(x,y,z) = p(p(x,y,z),x,p(x,z,y))
\]
is a minority term. The fact can be derived from these
observations.
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}
A variety of groups has a minority term if and only
the variety has exponent 2 (well, or 1).
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
If a variety has exponent 2 then it is abelian and so,
using additive notation, $x + y + z$ is a minority term.

If the exponent is not 2 then the variety contains a group
which contains an element of order $n$, where $n > 2$ (or 
infinite). This element generates a cyclic group. In any
abelian algebra the Maltsev term operation is unique and so
must be $x - y + z$. But one easily checks that this is not
a minority term when $n > 2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\mathcal V$ be a CP variety with a Maltsev term $p(x,y.z)$.
The the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The ring $R(\mathcal V)$ of $\mathcal V$ has characteristic~2.
\item
On every block of every abelian congruence, $p$ restricted to the 
block is a minority term; that is, satisfies $p(a,b,a) = b$.
\item
If $\theta = \textup{Cg}^{\alg F_{\mathcal V}(x,y)}(x,y)$, then,
on each block of $\theta/[\theta,\theta]$, $p$ is a minority term.
\end{enumerate}
If $\mathcal V$ has a minority term, then these conditions hold.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By commutator theory (give some specific refs, also that the ring
is det by the strucure of $\theta/[\theta,\theta]$) 
the Maltsev term operation on an
abelian algebra, or even a block of an abelian congruence, 
is unique and it is $p(x,y,z) = x - y + z$ for
some abelian group. It is easy that $x - y + z$ is a minority
if and only if the abelian group has exponent~2.
\end{proof}

Let $\alg A$ be an algebra and let $S$ and $T$ be tolerances
on $\alg A$. 
Let $M(S,T)$, or $M^{\alg A}(S,T)$ to emphasize $\alg A$,
be the set of all $2 \times 2$ matrices of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq1}
\begin{bmatrix}
p&q\\
r&s
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
f(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{u})&f(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{v})\\
f(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{u})&f(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{v})
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$ is an $(m+n)$-ary polynomial of
$\alg A$, $\mathbf{a} \mathrel{S} \mathbf{b}$, and 
$\mathbf{u} \mathrel{T} \mathbf{v}$
(componentwise, of course). The members of $M(S,T)$ are called
\emph{$S,T$-matrices}.

The first exercise gives an efficient way to find $M(S,T)$.

\section*{Exercises}

\begin{exercises}

\prob
Show that $M(S,T)$ is the subalgebra of $\alg A^4$ generated by
\[
\left\{
\begin{bmatrix}
a&a\\
b&b
\end{bmatrix} : a \mathrel{S} b\right\}
\union
\left\{
\begin{bmatrix}
c&d\\
c&d
\end{bmatrix} : c \mathrel{T} d\right\}
\]

\prob
Use the symmetry of $S$ and $T$ to show the matrix obtained from an
$S,T$-matrix by interchanging the rows or columns (or both) is also
in $M(S,T)$. 

\prob
$M(T,T)$ is closed under taking transposes. 

\end{exercises}

\section*{Centrality Relations}

We define four kinds of centrality, called centrality, strong
centrality, weak centrality, and strong rectularity. The is a fifth
centrality condition known as rectangularity which we will save for
later.

Let $\delta$ be a congruence and $S$ and $T$ be
tolerance relations on  $\alg A$. The above centrality relations
are denoted $\alg C(S,T;\delta)$ (centrality), 
$\alg S(S,T;\delta)$ (strong centrality), 
$\alg W(S,T;\delta)$ (weak centrality),  and
$\alg SR(S,T;\delta)$ (strong rectangularity). They hold if the
appropriate implication below holds for all 
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
p&q\\
r&s
\end{bmatrix} \in M(S,T)
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item centrality: 
$p \mathrel{\delta} q \implies r \mathrel{\delta} s$.
\item strong rectangularity: 
$p \mathrel{\delta} s \implies r \mathrel{\delta} s$.
\item weak centrality: 
$p \mathrel{\delta} q \mathrel{\delta} s \implies r \mathrel{\delta} s$.
\item strong centrality holds if both centrality and strong
rectangularity hold.
\end{itemize}

Using the exercises it is easy to see that the implication defining 
$\alg C(S,T;\delta)$ can be replaced by 
$r \mathrel{\delta} s \implies p \mathrel{\delta} q$ and this is
equivalent to 
\[
p \mathrel{\delta} q \Longleftrightarrow r \mathrel{\delta} s.
\]
Similar statements hold for the other conditions: weak centrality
is equivalent to saying that if any three of $p$, $q$, $r$ and $s$
are $\delta$ related, then they all are. And strong rectangularity
says that if the elements of the main diagonal, or of the sinister
diagonal, are $\delta$ related, then all four are.

The \emph{$S,T$-term condition} is the condition $\alg C(S,T,0)$,
usually expressed using the right-hand matrix in~\eqref{eq1}. 
Other kinds of term conditions are defined similarly. 

If $\alg C(S,T;\delta_i)$ holds for all $i \in I$, then
$\alg C(S,T;\Meet_{i\in I}\delta_i)$ holds. Similar statements hold
for the other centrality conditions. So there is a least $\delta$
such that $\alg C(S,T;\delta)$ holds. This $\delta$ is the 
\emph{commutator} of $S$ and $T$, and is denoted $[S,T]$. The
commutators for the other centrality relations are denoted
$[S,T]_{\alg S}$, $[S,T]_{\alg {SR}}$, and $[S,T]_{\alg W}$.

The properties of these centrality relations are coverered in
Theorem~2.19 and Theorem~3.4 of~\cite{KearnesKiss2013}. Much stronger
properties hold in congruence modular varieties;
see~\cite{FreeseMcKenzie1987}.

\section*{Exercises}

\begin{exercises}

\prob
As defined in \cite{HobbyMcKenzie1988}, $\beta$ is \emph{strongly
Abelian} over $\delta$ ($\delta \leq \beta$, both congruences on $\alg A$)
if the following implication holds for all polynomials $f$ and all
elements $x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}$, $y_0, \ldots, y_{n-1}$, and 
$z_1, \ldots, z_{n-1}$ with $x_0 \mathrel\beta y_0$ and
$x_i \mathrel\beta y_i \mathrel\beta z_i$, $i = 1, \ldots n-1$.
\begin{align*}
f(x_0,\ldots,&x_{n-1}) \mathrel\delta f(y_0,\ldots,y_{n-1}) \\
&\implies
f(x_0, z_1,\ldots,z_{n-1}) \mathrel\delta f(y_0, z_1,\ldots,z_{n-1})
\end{align*}
Show that $\beta$ is strongly 
Abelian over $\delta$ if and only if $\alg S(\beta,\beta;\delta)$ 
holds, and also show this is in turn equivalent to
$\alg {SR}(\beta,\beta;\delta)$.
