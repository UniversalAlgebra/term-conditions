We give a positive answer to the following practical question: Given a finite idempotent algebra $\mathbf A$, can we efficiently decide whether the variety generated by $\mathbf A$ has a difference term?  It is well known that a locally finite variety $\mathcal V$ has a difference term if and only if the variety generated by $\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal V}(2)$ has a difference term.  In fact, this is equivalent to $\mathbf{F}_{\mathcal V}(2)$ itself having a difference term operation.  We use this fact and an adaptation of Valeriote and Willard's ``local term condition'' strategy to devise a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether the variety generated by a finite idempotent algebra has a difference term.
