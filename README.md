## Research on the computational complexity of properties of algebras

The files in this repository are related to our research on testing
for existence of certain kinds of terms, or the omission of certain
ideals of tct types, in varieties generated by finite algebras.

Most of this work was carried out at the University of Hawaii during
the Fall 2016 and Spring 2017 semesters in the *Universal Algebra and
Lattice Theory Seminar.*

**Seminar Participants:** William DeMeo, Ralph Freese, Alex Guillen, Tristan Holmes, Bill Lampe, JB Nation, Matt Valeriote

**Abridged List of Files**

+ [PITCHME.md](https://github.com/UniversalAlgebra/term-conditions/blob/master/PITCHME.md) --- this file is used to create slides for a talk about our work.  To view the slides, visit [the gitpitch page](https://gitpitch.com/UniversalAlgebra/term-conditions).  To improve the slides, edit the [PITCHME.md file](https://github.com/UniversalAlgebra/term-conditions/blob/master/PITCHME.md).

+ [DiffTerm](https://github.com/UniversalAlgebra/term-conditions/tree/master/DiffTerm) --- a draft of a paper describing our work on this project.

+ [notes](https://bitbucket.org/universalalgebra/diff-term-existence/src/094bad9d1f14ca5aee7add9292240b572c813640/notes/?at=master) --- notes about some of the things we discussed during the seminar.

+ [nsjom](https://bitbucket.org/universalalgebra/diff-term-existence/src/094bad9d1f14ca5aee7add9292240b572c813640/nsjom/?at=master) --- a rough draft of an alternative paper-in-progress describing a polytime algorithm for deciding whether a finite idempotent algebra has a difference term.

+ [alt-comm](https://bitbucket.org/universalalgebra/diff-term-existence/src/094bad9d1f14ca5aee7add9292240b572c813640/alt-comm/?at=master) --- includes a short note on a description of the commutator that explains how it can be computed in polynomial-time.
